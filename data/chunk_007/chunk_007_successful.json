This defines a stable, measurable, although not static position.</p>\n<p>A dynamic equilibrium requires finding a stable zone in order to deal with a system that is in permanent evolution.</p>\n<p>After the necessary adaptive knowledge needed to adapt to an environment is defined it becomes necessary to define the actions that have to be done in order to influence the system. These actions need to be defined in a universal way in order to be able to adapt to situations that are changing.</p>\n<p>This becomes possible if the conceptual foundations are known.

A learning object needs to define the actions which are included in the procedural long term memory.</p>\n<p>To install true action driven knowledge it is necessary to have a picture of functional experiences in the episodic memory that allow an analogical approach and provide the final picture of the actions to be developed.</p>\n<p>When this has been achieved it is necessary that the learning object allows storing the idea of the concepts that provides the guiding idea of the actions and the unicist ontological structure and the mechanics to use it in the semantic memory.</p>\n<p>Finally, the minimum strategy has been achieved using dynamic learning objects when the procedural memory has the actions that are included in the structure of the cognitive object.

A number of NAPAs gave consideration to local knowledge systems and the presence of Indigenous Peoples.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/workstreams/the-nairobi-work-programme-the-unfccc-knowledge-to-action-hub-for-climate-adaptation-and-resilience\">Nairobi Work Programme</a> on Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change, which provided a forum for Indigenous Peoples, local communities and civil society to engage with each other on adaptation practices, was formalized during COP 12, in 2006.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/the-big-picture/introduction\">Cancun Adaptation Framework</a>, an architecture that created opportunities for Indigenous Peoples and local communities to engage more directly on issues of concern while creating a coherent architecture within the Convention, was established during COP 16 in 2010.</p><p>Reports by the Nairobi Work Programme (NWP) partners dealing with Indigenous and local knowledge were taken into consideration during COP 19 (Warsaw, Poland, 2013). The Adaptation Committee recognized that these reports were an important contribution and recommended that NWP be given a mandate to elaborate this as a work stream, with a concept paper and expert consultations. This COP 19 decision fast-tracked the attention of the Convention to the role of Indigenous and local knowledge holders.</p></div></div>",

        "text": "<div><p>Remote working has become a prevalent and often necessary mode of work for many people in the current stage, influenced significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic. Now you don’t have to compromise on time, staying up late cause you want to catch up with a team member in another timezone (well, except for meetings.)</p><p>Organizational learning (OL) and knowledge management (KM) play a huge role in making the above possible. <strong>How?</strong> The only reason you can do your job effectively without needing to wait for a team member is because of <strong>information.</strong> You have the right information to do your job without having to wait.</p><p>OL and KM provide knowledge accessibility and applicability to teams. In this article, you will understand why businesses leverage Organizational Learning in collaboration with Knowledge Management.</p><div>\n<div>\n<h2>Organizational Learning and its Significance</h2>\n<p>Organizational learning involves acquiring knowledge, skills, and insights at an organizational level.</p>\n<p>A company is never the same after a couple of years; the market is changing, staff are evolving, and products are different. Because change is constant, you need organizational learning because it will drive the company to adapt, evolve, and remain competitive.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge Management in Organizations</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://document360.com/knowledge-management/\">Knowledge management</a> is how organizations gather, organize, and share information with employees, customers, and business partners.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Power of Organizational Learning and Collaboration with Knowledge Management</h2>\n<p>Organizational Learning (OL) and Knowledge Management (KM) function as catalysts within a company, increasing innovation and competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>The foundation of an organization’s success lies in collaboration and knowledge sharing. But this comes with its problems due to diverse views and opinions. However, properly implementing of OL and KM will create a system where every unique perspective is appreciated and critically evaluated, leading to well-informed decision-making.</p>\n<h3>Accelerated Innovation</h3>\n<p>Organizations need to build an <a href=\"https://document360.com/internal-knowledge-base-software/\">internal knowledge hub</a> that allows employees to access information, be more interactive among team members, and share each other’s knowledge while saving time for ideas. But that’s not all. They also need to promote a culture of continuous learning among leaders and employees.</p>\n<p><strong>The result?</strong> Accelerated innovation.</p>\n<p>A solid knowledge management system like Document 360 and continuous learning can facilitate information sharing and speed up access to knowledge, increasing innovation.</p>\n<h3>Adaptability in a Dynamic Landscape</h3>\n<div><p>The business landscape has experienced many changes and is predicted to keep changing. To keep up with the tide, organizations are advised to make strategic decisions in line with industry benchmarks.</p><p>\nA study by <a href=\"https://focus.kornferry.com/introducing-a-new-breed-of-future-ready-leaders/#topofpage\">Korn Ferry</a> emphasized that 85% of leaders believe their organizations need more time to be ready for the speed of change.</p></div>\n<p>This is where organizational learning and knowledge management come in. They provide the tools and mindset (collective learning and shared knowledge) needed to adapt to these dynamic business landscapes.</p>\n<h3>Holistic Problem Solving</h3>\n<p>Problems within an organization are like puzzles. They come in different shapes and sizes, each requiring a unique problem-solving approach. Often, more than one perspective is needed to crack the code; hence, a holistic problem-solving approach is needed.</p>\n<p>If two heads are better than one, imagine what multiple heads would do; the pooling of knowledge through Organizational Learning and Knowledge Management promotes holistic problem-solving by letting employees <strong>look at a problem and develop solutions that consider multiple perspectives.</strong></p>\n<h3>Synergy of Expertise</h3>\n<p>The principle of synergy in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory\">Systems Theory</a> postulates that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” An organization is a system, and its human resources make up an essential part. Thus, only the best output is obtained when people with different skills and knowledge come together in a team. In any organization, each person brings their own unique abilities and experiences to the table.</p>\n<p>Organizational learning and knowledge management are all about tapping into this collective expertise. A synergy of different teams combines individual strengths to create a driving force that helps the organization succeed beyond expectations.</p>\n<h3>Employee Empowerment</h3>\n<p>The motivational theories of management highlight the importance of employee empowerment. There’s a reason why people do what they do, and there’s always a motivation behind it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://document360.com/knowledge-sharing/\">Knowledge sharing</a> allows leaders to understand each employee’s personality and motivation. Then, they can build on that information to create an environment that empowers employees and increases productivity.</p>\n<p>Building an environment that encourages knowledge-sharing and continuous learning empowers your employees; their work is easier, they don’t have to run through hoops to find information, and they can share ideas without fear of rejection. Everyone is happy.</p>\n<h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>\n<p>LinkedIn’s <a href=\"https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report\">2019 Workforce Learning Report</a> shows that 94% of employees are likely to stay with a company that invests in their learning and development.</p>\n<p>Creating a culture of continuous learning, which is at the heart of organizational learning and knowledge management, encourages employee improvement, which is paramount to excellence. A key aspect of this culture is the adoption of <a href=\"https://360learning.com/blog/skills-based-learning/\">skills based learning</a>, focusing on practical and applicable skills that directly enhance employee capabilities and align with the company’s strategic goals.</p>\n<h3>Effective Communication</h3>\n<p>Poor communication within a team will lead to misinformation and goal congruence, leading to a high employee turnover rate due to resulting misunderstandings and workplace instability. Employees who feel unheard or undervalued are more likely to seek opportunities elsewhere, threatening the going concern concept of the organization and increasing the learning curve.</p>\n<p>Knowledge Management and Organizational Learning create means of communication for your employees, promoting cross-team collaboration and reducing silos.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge Preservation</h3>\n<p>Trade strategies, secrets, and compasses are valuable and should be preserved so that they can be passed on to others in the event of an employee leaving. This is where knowledge preservation comes in.</p>\n<p>Knowledge preservation involves capturing, organizing, and storing critical information and experiences.</p>\n<p>You can use the Document360 <a href=\"https://document360.com/knowledgebase-site/\">knowledge base site</a> feature to store and manage documents. In the case of trade strategies and secrets, you can make the site private (requiring users to log in) and restrict access to a certain IP range for extra security.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Schedule a demo with one of our experts to take a deeper dive into Document360</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://document360.com/request-demo/\">Book A Demo</a></p></div>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n<h3>Cultivation of Leadership</h3>\n<p>Leadership is not just a position; it’s a quality that, when nurtured, can transform an organization. Effective leadership propels a company towards its vision, motivates teams, and fosters a positive work culture.</p>\n<p>According to a report by LinkedIn, <a href=\"https://learning.linkedin.com/elearning-solutions-guides/developing-employees-into-leaders\">86% of companies say developing new leaders</a> is an urgent or important need.

        "html": "<div><p>Remote working has become a prevalent and often necessary mode of work for many people in the current stage, influenced significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic. Now you don’t have to compromise on time, staying up late cause you want to catch up with a team member in another timezone (well, except for meetings.)</p><p>Organizational learning (OL) and knowledge management (KM) play a huge role in making the above possible. <strong>How?</strong> The only reason you can do your job effectively without needing to wait for a team member is because of <strong>information.</strong> You have the right information to do your job without having to wait.</p><p>OL and KM provide knowledge accessibility and applicability to teams. In this article, you will understand why businesses leverage Organizational Learning in collaboration with Knowledge Management.</p><div>\n<div>\n<h2>Organizational Learning and its Significance</h2>\n<p>Organizational learning involves acquiring knowledge, skills, and insights at an organizational level.</p>\n<p>A company is never the same after a couple of years; the market is changing, staff are evolving, and products are different. Because change is constant, you need organizational learning because it will drive the company to adapt, evolve, and remain competitive.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge Management in Organizations</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://document360.com/knowledge-management/\">Knowledge management</a> is how organizations gather, organize, and share information with employees, customers, and business partners.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Power of Organizational Learning and Collaboration with Knowledge Management</h2>\n<p>Organizational Learning (OL) and Knowledge Management (KM) function as catalysts within a company, increasing innovation and competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>The foundation of an organization’s success lies in collaboration and knowledge sharing. But this comes with its problems due to diverse views and opinions. However, properly implementing of OL and KM will create a system where every unique perspective is appreciated and critically evaluated, leading to well-informed decision-making.</p>\n<h3>Accelerated Innovation</h3>\n<p>Organizations need to build an <a href=\"https://document360.com/internal-knowledge-base-software/\">internal knowledge hub</a> that allows employees to access information, be more interactive among team members, and share each other’s knowledge while saving time for ideas. But that’s not all. They also need to promote a culture of continuous learning among leaders and employees.</p>\n<p><strong>The result?</strong> Accelerated innovation.</p>\n<p>A solid knowledge management system like Document 360 and continuous learning can facilitate information sharing and speed up access to knowledge, increasing innovation.</p>\n<h3>Adaptability in a Dynamic Landscape</h3>\n<div><p>The business landscape has experienced many changes and is predicted to keep changing. To keep up with the tide, organizations are advised to make strategic decisions in line with industry benchmarks.</p><p>\nA study by <a href=\"https://focus.kornferry.com/introducing-a-new-breed-of-future-ready-leaders/#topofpage\">Korn Ferry</a> emphasized that 85% of leaders believe their organizations need more time to be ready for the speed of change.</p></div>\n<p>This is where organizational learning and knowledge management come in. They provide the tools and mindset (collective learning and shared knowledge) needed to adapt to these dynamic business landscapes.</p>\n<h3>Holistic Problem Solving</h3>\n<p>Problems within an organization are like puzzles. They come in different shapes and sizes, each requiring a unique problem-solving approach. Often, more than one perspective is needed to crack the code; hence, a holistic problem-solving approach is needed.</p>\n<p>If two heads are better than one, imagine what multiple heads would do; the pooling of knowledge through Organizational Learning and Knowledge Management promotes holistic problem-solving by letting employees <strong>look at a problem and develop solutions that consider multiple perspectives.</strong></p>\n<h3>Synergy of Expertise</h3>\n<p>The principle of synergy in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory\">Systems Theory</a> postulates that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” An organization is a system, and its human resources make up an essential part. Thus, only the best output is obtained when people with different skills and knowledge come together in a team. In any organization, each person brings their own unique abilities and experiences to the table.</p>\n<p>Organizational learning and knowledge management are all about tapping into this collective expertise. A synergy of different teams combines individual strengths to create a driving force that helps the organization succeed beyond expectations.</p>\n<h3>Employee Empowerment</h3>\n<p>The motivational theories of management highlight the importance of employee empowerment. There’s a reason why people do what they do, and there’s always a motivation behind it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://document360.com/knowledge-sharing/\">Knowledge sharing</a> allows leaders to understand each employee’s personality and motivation. Then, they can build on that information to create an environment that empowers employees and increases productivity.</p>\n<p>Building an environment that encourages knowledge-sharing and continuous learning empowers your employees; their work is easier, they don’t have to run through hoops to find information, and they can share ideas without fear of rejection. Everyone is happy.</p>\n<h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>\n<p>LinkedIn’s <a href=\"https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report\">2019 Workforce Learning Report</a> shows that 94% of employees are likely to stay with a company that invests in their learning and development.</p>\n<p>Creating a culture of continuous learning, which is at the heart of organizational learning and knowledge management, encourages employee improvement, which is paramount to excellence. A key aspect of this culture is the adoption of <a href=\"https://360learning.com/blog/skills-based-learning/\">skills based learning</a>, focusing on practical and applicable skills that directly enhance employee capabilities and align with the company’s strategic goals.</p>\n<h3>Effective Communication</h3>\n<p>Poor communication within a team will lead to misinformation and goal congruence, leading to a high employee turnover rate due to resulting misunderstandings and workplace instability. Employees who feel unheard or undervalued are more likely to seek opportunities elsewhere, threatening the going concern concept of the organization and increasing the learning curve.</p>\n<p>Knowledge Management and Organizational Learning create means of communication for your employees, promoting cross-team collaboration and reducing silos.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge Preservation</h3>\n<p>Trade strategies, secrets, and compasses are valuable and should be preserved so that they can be passed on to others in the event of an employee leaving. This is where knowledge preservation comes in.</p>\n<p>Knowledge preservation involves capturing, organizing, and storing critical information and experiences.</p>\n<p>You can use the Document360 <a href=\"https://document360.com/knowledgebase-site/\">knowledge base site</a> feature to store and manage documents. In the case of trade strategies and secrets, you can make the site private (requiring users to log in) and restrict access to a certain IP range for extra security.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Schedule a demo with one of our experts to take a deeper dive into Document360</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://document360.com/request-demo/\">Book A Demo</a></p></div>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n<h3>Cultivation of Leadership</h3>\n<p>Leadership is not just a position; it’s a quality that, when nurtured, can transform an organization. Effective leadership propels a company towards its vision, motivates teams, and fosters a positive work culture.</p>\n<p>According to a report by LinkedIn, <a href=\"https://learning.linkedin.com/elearning-solutions-guides/developing-employees-into-leaders\">86% of companies say developing new leaders</a> is an urgent or important need. OL and KM provide the learning environment necessary for <a href=\"https://www.risely.me/what-is-leadership-development/\">leadership development</a> because through the collaborative learning it offers, talents are identified and appropriate leaders are easily appointed.</p>\n<h3>Informed Decision-Making</h3>\n<p>Organizations need information in order to make decisions that are in line with their mission and vision statements. This information is necessary to avoid misdirection and poor implementation of strategies.</p>\n<p>Organizational learning grants an organization access to a rich knowledge repository that serves as a map for strategizing and decision-making in every stage of the organization’s life cycle.</p>\n<h3>Faster Learning Cycles</h3>\n<p>An organization has to go through the learning process for the rest of its existence, all thanks to the dynamic nature of business.
