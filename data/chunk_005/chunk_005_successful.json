        "text": "The Acquisition of Recursive Modification in\nNPs\nAna T. Pérez-Leroux\nUniversity of Toronto\nTyler Peterson\nArizona State University\nAnny Castilla-Earls\nUniversity of Houston\nSusana Béjar\nUniversity of Toronto\nDiane Massam\nUniversity of Toronto\nYves Roberge\nUniversity of Toronto\n1 Introduction\nThe growth of linguistic competence from telegraphic speech to full adult compe\u0002tence involves the production of longer, increasingly complex utterances. It seems\nnatural to assume that the complexity of a given structure is the same whether it is\ngenerated by the grammar of a child or an adult. However, it is not clear whether\nsentences containing more elaborated structure are more difficult for speakers,\nand whether difficulties arise to the same degree in children and adult speakers.\nMaking clear predictions is hindered in part because the field lacks a coherent un\u0002derstanding or consensus of what constitutes complexity in grammar (Culicover\n2013; Roeper & Speas 2014; Trotzke & Bayer 2015; Newmeyer & Preston 2014;\nMcWhorter 2011). Despite the heterogeneity of perspectives, most discussions\nof grammatical complexity assume that structural elaboration in general, and em\u0002bedding specifically, introduces complexity (Culicover & Jackendoff 2006; Givón\n2009). In this paper we seek to better understand the effects of structural elabora\u0002tion in grammar by isolating degree of embedding and studying how it affects the\nperformance of children and adults.\nOur focus is the production of complex noun phrases (NPs) containing recur\u0002sive prepositional phrase (PP) modifiers.1 Modification is one of the most basic\nforms of NP elaboration. Under one view, its use in natural language is regulated\n1\nPérez-Leroux, A., T. Peterson, A. Castilla, S. Béjar, D. Massam, and Y. Roberge. to appear.\n“The Acquisition of Recursive Modification in NPs” in Language.\nby the Gricean Maxim of Quantity: speakers provide just enough information to\nidentify a referent, but no more than is needed. Speakers make choices about the\nquantity of descriptive content to be expressed when labeling a referent, and these\nchoices are conditioned by discourse and context (Heller & Chambers 2014; Se\u0002divy 2003; Davies & Katsos 2013; Tanenhaus et al. 1995). Our understanding of\nhow children make choices to elaborate an NP, however, is less clear. The acquisi\u0002tion literature contains two seemingly conflicting observations about the referen\u0002tial skills of children. On one hand, experimental results show that five-year-olds\nare highly sensitive to context in their production of modified NPs. They use ad\u0002jectives (the small glass) only when a competing referent is present in the context\n(e.g. a large glass), and only when this competing referent is accessible to their\ninterlocutor (Nadig & Sedivy 2002). On the other hand, there appears to be a\nproductivity gap in children’s production of complex NPs, as most of the nouns\nthey produce spontaneously are unmodified nominals. Children’s use of modifi\u0002cation seems more limited for embedded PP modifiers than for adjectives. Re\u0002cursively modified NPs are particularly challenging (Roeper 2011; Pérez-Leroux\net al. 2012b). This opens up the possibility that deployment of children’s refer\u0002ential abilities is constrained by properties of the structures themselves. The goal\nof this study is to explore the source of children’s difficulty with recursive modi\u0002fication, and to investigate whether such difficulties remain to a certain extent in\nadults. We seek to tease apart the basis for the difficulty arising from this type\nof embedding, in order to ascertain whether it is best described in syntactic or\nsemantic terms, and in derivational or representational terms.\nTo do so, we investigate the production of two types of doubly-modified def\u0002inite descriptions. The two cases differ minimally with respect to the attachment\nof the second modifier. Consider the scenarios in Figures 1 and 2, which serve as\nvisual context for a question requiring the identification of a unique referent.\n2\nFigure 1: Which plate got broken?\nFigure 2: Which bird got the worm?\nThe correct answer to the question in Figure 1 involves simple modification:\nthe highest NP is sequentially modified by two independent restrictive PPs, as\nshown in the bracketing analysis in 1. The response to the prompt in Figure 2\nalso involves two restrictive modifiers, but they are recursive: the second modifier\nrestricts the referent contained in the first PP modifier, as shown in 2:\n(1) The plate [ under the table ] [ with oranges ]\n(2) The bird [ on the alligator [ in the water ] ]\nThese two NP types, Sequential Double Modification (SDM) and Recursive\nDouble Modification (RDM), constitute a minimal pair distinguished only by level\nof embedding. Comparing the two allows us to tease apart quantity of descriptive\ncontent (e.g. number of modifiers) from level of embedding.\nThis article presents an elicited production study of children’s and adults’ pro\u0002duction of the two types of complex NPs described above. Section 2 discusses the\nbasic semantic and syntactic properties of modification, leading to the formulation\n3\nof a null hypothesis: that SDM and RDM should pattern alike. This null hypothe\u0002sis is then considered in light of a recent proposal about the consequences of em\u0002bedding for semantic interpretation, and an alternative hypothesis is formulated.\nSection 3 summarizes the literature on children’s difficulties with modification in\ngeneral, and specifically with recursive structures. Section 4 presents our study\nand the results, pointing to the need to reject the null hypothesis. Section 5 ex\u0002plores the limitations of a purely syntactic or semantic approach to characterizing\nour results and proposes some alternative ways of analyzing the contrasts revealed\ntherein.\n2 Syntax and semantics of nominal modification\nIn this section we examine specific differences in the syntactic and semantic rep\u0002resentations of the two types of complex nominals (SDM and RDM). We first\nexamine some basic formal assumptions about the internal structure and interpre\u0002tation of modified DPs. Then we consider their derivational properties in light of\nphase theory.\n2.1 The formal ingredients of modification\nOur first observation is that SDM and RDM structures are syntactically identical\nwith respect to the inventory of individual syntactic elements and steps or opera\u0002tions involved in combining them. If we take each step in their syntactic derivation\nto be an instance of the Merge operation, the two kinds of expressions contain the\nsame number of iterations of Merge.2In terms of Merge, the only difference be\u0002tween the structures is whether the second PP modifier is merged higher (SDM)\nor lower (RDM). There is no a priori reason to think that any given instance of\nMerge, higher or lower, is somehow more difficult than another. Nor is there any\na priori reason to think that merging a more complex PP (as in RDM) should be\nmore difficult than merging a simpler one (as in SDM). This is particularly so in a\nphase-based model (Chomsky 2001), where at each cycle the lower structure be\u0002comes impenetrable and inaccessible to subsequent computations. In sum, from a\nsyntactic point of view, in principle, there should be no difference in complexity\nbetween SDM and RDM.3\nA similar conclusion can be reached regarding the semantics of SDM and\nRDM structures. Nominal expressions map onto entities or set-denoting predi\u0002cates, depending on the type of noun (Lily, dog), and the presence or absence\n4\nof determiners (the dog, dog). Languages vary as to the presence of determin\u0002ers, with consequences for the semantic mapping of NPs (Chierchia 1998; Partee\n2002). The semantic type of a nominal expression is also partially determined by\nits syntactic position, as shown in the contrast between referential and predicative\nuses of DPs (a dog barked vs. Lily is a dog). The type of a constituent shifts as\nthe constituent is subsequently merged with additional constituents to build higher\nextended projections. In textbook analyses of simple phrases such as 3, the NP\ndenotes a predicate, and the determiner phrase (DP) denotes an entity (cf. Heim\n& Kratzer 1998):\n(3) [DP the [NP table ] ]\nPrepositions generally express a two-place relation between entities. When\ncombined with a nominal constituent, the preposition shifts the type of the con\u0002stituent from entity to predicate. This is evidenced by their use in copular con\u0002structions, as in 4, or in restrictive NP modification, as in 5:\n(4) The vase is [PP on [DP the table ]]\n(5) [DP The vase [PP on [DP the table ]]]\nOne consequence of embedding is that the embedded nominal expression no\nlonger functions as a referring expression, but as a descriptor (e.g. a predicate)\nof the nominal it modifies (Arsenijevic & Hinzen 2012). In 5, The lowest DP\nexpression (the table), now a constituent of the PP modifier, provides additional\ndescriptive content to the vase. The complex DP denotes an entity that is both a\nvase and is located on the table.\nWe can now consider what happens with DPs with sequential modification, as\nin 1, and compare them to those that have recursive modification, as in 2. The log\u0002ical representations help us to precisely pinpoint what is different between these\ntwo types of complex nominals. The DPs given in 1 and 2 are the corresponding\nfragments that can be given in response to the scenarios in Figures 1 and 2 (e.g.\nthe plate with oranges under the table got broken, and the bird on the alligator in\nthe water got the worm). Taking these visual scenarios as models, we can provide\ntruth conditions for the corresponding propositions. The truth conditions for 1 are\ngiven in 6.4 Here we have two PP predicates that simultaneously restrict the iota\noperator that picks out the (unique) plate x such that x has oranges and x is under\nthe table.\n(6) TRUE:\nbroken(ιx(plate(x)∧ιy(table(y)∧under(xy))∧ιz(oranges(z)∧with(xz))))\n5\nIn 7 we describe the truth conditions for 2:\n(7) a.

IMPROVABLE IDEAS</strong></p>\n<p>Ideas generated by students e.g. through discussion, are treated as improvable rather than simply accepted or rejected; work proceeds continuously to improve the explanatory power, coherence and utility of ideas —&gt; The goal is not searching for a perfect answer or the final state but for the best explanation, solution, product, or understandings on which we can build.</p>\n<p><strong>The teacher or e-environment (for instance Knowledge Forum) role:</strong></p>\n<p>- to support revision in all aspects of the design of ideas —there is always a higher level to take ideas, there is always opportunity to rework and refine contributions.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Things you may hear that reflect this principle...</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>“Let’s design an experiment,” “How does it work, REALLY?”, “We used to think..., now we think...”</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Constructive actions</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The teacher makes it clear to students that all ideas are good and improvable.

The central question revolved around how to actively engage a community\nof diverse university students from different academic, social and ethnic backgrounds in working as\npartners to co-construct knowledge in a pre-service teacher course. Applying a student-centered\npedagogy informed by social constructivism, the authors reflect on how the student-generated\nmidterm exams challenged the participants to think about their approach to learning. Through this\nexperience, students were provided with multiple entry points to access the curriculum and were\nempowered as active agents of their own learning, while the instructor found an interactive arena for\nreflection on her own pedagogical practices in action. The authors propose a change from the\ntraditional teacher-centered lecture style to a higher education pedagogy that places students in\ncontrol of their own scholarship.\nIntroduction\nAs a higher education faculty member, I (faculty,\nfirst author) have always seen my role as a facilitator of\nlearning, guiding my students to be active and critical\nparticipants and agents of their own learning (Freire,\n1970). Because of this clear philosophy of teaching, I\nintentionally promote student-centered learning by\nstaying away from a traditional lecture style. During the\npast three years as an instructor of Pedagogical\nFoundations, a post-baccalaureate class open to\nundergraduate students in the Teacher Education\nprogram, I have continued to wrestle with how to make\nmy class an arena where students feel they can take\nownership of their own learning and are empowered to\nconstruct knowledge with the instructor as well as with\ntheir peers (Vygotsky, 1978).\nWhen examining education in the U.S., it is clear\nthat nurturing critical thinkers and independent\nlearners in post-secondary education is a more\nserious challenge today than ever before, at a time\nwhen our overall international academic standing has\ndeclined (OECD, 2010) and the classroom itself has\nundergone extreme demographic changes. Students\ntoday are more diverse than at any point in history\n(Santangelo & Tomlinson, 2009). For example, at\nour own university in Southern California, which is\nconsidered one of the most diverse post-secondary\ninstitutions in the U.S., White, Hispanic,\nAsian/Pacific Islander, and Black students comprise\n25%, 30%, 26%, and 3.5% respectively of the entire\ncampus student population (California State\nPolytechnic University, Pomona, 2009). Based on\nthese statistics, White students are no longer a\nmajority but are the minority here.\nDespite the benefits to society inherent in improved\naccess to education for all groups, this increasing racial\nand ethnic diversification creates a persistent challenge.\nThere have been heated discussions nationally about\nclosing the achievement gap between White and other\nstudents from various minority groups. Within our K-12\nschool system, a clear divide exists between student\ngroups that differ from one another racially, culturally,\nlinguistically, socioeconomically, and geographically\n(Cochran-Smith, 2010; Ladson-Billings, 2009;\nCochran-Smith & Zeichner, 2005; Darling-Hammond,\n2006). According to the National Assessment\nEducational Progress (NAEP), while 51% of White\nfourth-graders scored at or above the proficient level in\nmathematics, only 16% of African American, 22% of\nHispanic, 21% of Native-American students, and 12%\nof English Learners reached this level. Similarly, in\nreading, 42% of White fourth-graders scored at or\nabove proficiency level, while only 16% of African\nAmerican, 17% of Hispanic, 20% of Native American\nstudents, and 6% of English Learners scored at the\nsame level (NCES, 2009).\nAlthough standardized testing of this sort is not\nadministered to college students, we can view the same\nachievement gap by examining retention rates among\nvarious demographic groups. Although 57% of all\nstudents nationally finish their bachelor degrees in six\nyears or less, the graduation rates for various groups of\nstudents differ markedly, according to the Education\nTrust. Whereas 60% of White students earn their\nbachelor’s degrees within this time frame, only 49% of\nLatinos and 40% of African-Americans accomplish the\nsame (Education Trust Data, 2010).\nThe question, then, becomes one of figuring out\nhow to actively engage a community of diverse learners\nand provide entry points for each student, regardless of\nhis or her prior academic preparation, current skill\nlevel, and background. How do we partner with\nstudents to inspire them to be active and critical\nAhn and Class Student-Centered Pedagogy 270\nlearners? We propose that the social constructivist\nmodel based on Lev Vygotsky (1978) can inform a\npowerful pedagogical approach to teaching and learning\nin post-secondary classrooms.\nThe application of Vygotsky’s social constructivist\nmodel of learning is not entirely new. John Dewey, in\nthe early 1900’s, proposed lessening the use of\ncompetition in education and urged structuring schools\nas democratic learning communities (Woolfolk, 2007).\nThis concept, commonly called “cooperative learning”\nor “collaborative learning,” was further developed by\nSlavin and other scholars who saw the opportunity to\npromote student learning of academic content in small\ngroups so that students could help one another (Slavin,\n1995).\nAlthough not without criticism, educators have\nrecognized the cooperative format as a powerful tool in\nthe K-12 classroom and embraced the benefits of\nproviding students with the opportunity to work in\nsmall groups rather than relying entirely on the lecture\nformat. This inclusive approach, based on Vygotsky’s\nsocial constructivist model, encourages learners at\ndifferent academic levels to work together in the co\u0002construction of knowledge through active exploration\nand negotiation.\nPeer collaboration characterized by open dialogue\nhas proven effective over a broad range of subjects. For\nexample, in reading, Block, Parris, and Whitely (2008)\nfound that standardized reading test scores improved\namong 257 students at two urban elementary schools\nafter a twelve-week reading intervention program,\nwhich used kinesthetic strategies to teach students\neffective dialogue in both large group instruction and in\nsmall cooperative learning groups. In addition, two\nstudies examined the benefits of cooperative learning in\nmathematics. Dekkar, Elshout-Mohr, and Wood (2006)\nconducted a case study of two elementary school\nstudents in the area of self-regulation during a\ncollaborative math activity. The authors found that even\nvery young students can take responsibility for\nbalancing the various aspects of collaborative\nexperience and that they can successfully monitor\nthemselves and change their learning approach when\nnecessary. The other study by Kramarski and Mevarech\n(2003) examined mathematical performance of eighth\ngraders who received direct instruction in\nmetacognitive and communication strategies. The\nresults of the study revealed that first, cooperative\nlearning groups markedly outperformed students who\nreceived individualized math instruction, and,\nmoreover, groups who received this direct instruction\noutperformed students who did not, whether they\nworked collaboratively or received individualized\ninstruction. In the area of academic writing, Carter\n(2009) described successfully structuring mathematical\nlearning in her classroom, first through whole and small\ngroup open dialogue surrounding mathematical\nconcepts and solutions, and later extending the\nexperience into academic writing. She found that using\ncollaborative discussion format facilitated students’\nacademic writing. Finally, in teaching history, Deaney,\nChapman, and Hennessy (2009) examined the use of\ninteractive whiteboard technology to support\ncooperative learning activities for middle school\nstudents through a series of six history lessons. The\nauthors found that this electronic medium provided a\nsupportive environment and a meaningful forum for\n“active student participation, encouraging students to\ntake responsibility for their own learning” (p.383).\nThese previous studies point to the importance of\nsmall group learning opportunities as good teaching\npractice. However, this particular approach has been\nslow to reach post-secondary education (De Kock,\nSleegers, & Voeten, 2004; Koljatic & Kuh, 2001),\nwhich continues to rely heavily on the lecture format\nand reward individual success. Recent studies\ndemonstrate, however, that cooperative group activities\nare well received by the majority of university students.\nFor example, Peterson and Miller (2004) surveyed\nundergraduate educational psychology students who\nparticipated in cooperative learning and large group\ninstruction regarding their perceptions of these\nexperiences. The study found that the students were\nmore engaged during cooperative learning and\nperceived that their learning task during cooperative\nlearning was more important. Hancock (2004)\nadditionally showed that the cooperative learning\nformat benefited even those who voiced a preference\nfor working alone. Moreover, modern technology as\nused in university coursework has proven adaptable to\nand beneficial for collaborative learning activities, as\nevidenced by the peer scaffolding identified by Pifarre\nand Cobos (2010) during a 12 month electronic\ndiscussion board learning project.\nIt is interesting to note that some K-12 and\nuniversity educators have expanded the collaborative\nlearning model by teaching metacognitive skills",

Because of this clear philosophy of teaching, I\nintentionally promote student-centered learning by\nstaying away from a traditional lecture style. During the\npast three years as an instructor of Pedagogical\nFoundations, a post-baccalaureate class open to\nundergraduate students in the Teacher Education\nprogram, I have continued to wrestle with how to make\nmy class an arena where students feel they can take\nownership of their own learning and are empowered to\nconstruct knowledge with the instructor as well as with\ntheir peers (Vygotsky, 1978).\nWhen examining education in the U.S., it is clear\nthat nurturing critical thinkers and independent\nlearners in post-secondary education is a more\nserious challenge today than ever before, at a time\nwhen our overall international academic standing has\ndeclined (OECD, 2010) and the classroom itself has\nundergone extreme demographic changes. Students\ntoday are more diverse than at any point in history\n(Santangelo & Tomlinson, 2009). For example, at\nour own university in Southern California, which is\nconsidered one of the most diverse post-secondary\ninstitutions in the U.S., White, Hispanic,\nAsian/Pacific Islander, and Black students comprise\n25%, 30%, 26%, and 3.5% respectively of the entire\ncampus student population (California State\nPolytechnic University, Pomona, 2009). Based on\nthese statistics, White students are no longer a\nmajority but are the minority here.\nDespite the benefits to society inherent in improved\naccess to education for all groups, this increasing racial\nand ethnic diversification creates a persistent challenge.\nThere have been heated discussions nationally about\nclosing the achievement gap between White and other\nstudents from various minority groups. Within our K-12\nschool system, a clear divide exists between student\ngroups that differ from one another racially, culturally,\nlinguistically, socioeconomically, and geographically\n(Cochran-Smith, 2010; Ladson-Billings, 2009;\nCochran-Smith & Zeichner, 2005; Darling-Hammond,\n2006). According to the National Assessment\nEducational Progress (NAEP), while 51% of White\nfourth-graders scored at or above the proficient level in\nmathematics, only 16% of African American, 22% of\nHispanic, 21% of Native-American students, and 12%\nof English Learners reached this level. Similarly, in\nreading, 42% of White fourth-graders scored at or\nabove proficiency level, while only 16% of African\nAmerican, 17% of Hispanic, 20% of Native American\nstudents, and 6% of English Learners scored at the\nsame level (NCES, 2009).\nAlthough standardized testing of this sort is not\nadministered to college students, we can view the same\nachievement gap by examining retention rates among\nvarious demographic groups. Although 57% of all\nstudents nationally finish their bachelor degrees in six\nyears or less, the graduation rates for various groups of\nstudents differ markedly, according to the Education\nTrust. Whereas 60% of White students earn their\nbachelor’s degrees within this time frame, only 49% of\nLatinos and 40% of African-Americans accomplish the\nsame (Education Trust Data, 2010).\nThe question, then, becomes one of figuring out\nhow to actively engage a community of diverse learners\nand provide entry points for each student, regardless of\nhis or her prior academic preparation, current skill\nlevel, and background. How do we partner with\nstudents to inspire them to be active and critical\nAhn and Class Student-Centered Pedagogy 270\nlearners? We propose that the social constructivist\nmodel based on Lev Vygotsky (1978) can inform a\npowerful pedagogical approach to teaching and learning\nin post-secondary classrooms.\nThe application of Vygotsky’s social constructivist\nmodel of learning is not entirely new. John Dewey, in\nthe early 1900’s, proposed lessening the use of\ncompetition in education and urged structuring schools\nas democratic learning communities (Woolfolk, 2007).\nThis concept, commonly called “cooperative learning”\nor “collaborative learning,” was further developed by\nSlavin and other scholars who saw the opportunity to\npromote student learning of academic content in small\ngroups so that students could help one another (Slavin,\n1995).\nAlthough not without criticism, educators have\nrecognized the cooperative format as a powerful tool in\nthe K-12 classroom and embraced the benefits of\nproviding students with the opportunity to work in\nsmall groups rather than relying entirely on the lecture\nformat. This inclusive approach, based on Vygotsky’s\nsocial constructivist model, encourages learners at\ndifferent academic levels to work together in the co\u0002construction of knowledge through active exploration\nand negotiation.\nPeer collaboration characterized by open dialogue\nhas proven effective over a broad range of subjects. For\nexample, in reading, Block, Parris, and Whitely (2008)\nfound that standardized reading test scores improved\namong 257 students at two urban elementary schools\nafter a twelve-week reading intervention program,\nwhich used kinesthetic strategies to teach students\neffective dialogue in both large group instruction and in\nsmall cooperative learning groups. In addition, two\nstudies examined the benefits of cooperative learning in\nmathematics. Dekkar, Elshout-Mohr, and Wood (2006)\nconducted a case study of two elementary school\nstudents in the area of self-regulation during a\ncollaborative math activity. The authors found that even\nvery young students can take responsibility for\nbalancing the various aspects of collaborative\nexperience and that they can successfully monitor\nthemselves and change their learning approach when\nnecessary. The other study by Kramarski and Mevarech\n(2003) examined mathematical performance of eighth\ngraders who received direct instruction in\nmetacognitive and communication strategies. The\nresults of the study revealed that first, cooperative\nlearning groups markedly outperformed students who\nreceived individualized math instruction, and,\nmoreover, groups who received this direct instruction\noutperformed students who did not, whether they\nworked collaboratively or received individualized\ninstruction. In the area of academic writing, Carter\n(2009) described successfully structuring mathematical\nlearning in her classroom, first through whole and small\ngroup open dialogue surrounding mathematical\nconcepts and solutions, and later extending the\nexperience into academic writing. She found that using\ncollaborative discussion format facilitated students’\nacademic writing. Finally, in teaching history, Deaney,\nChapman, and Hennessy (2009) examined the use of\ninteractive whiteboard technology to support\ncooperative learning activities for middle school\nstudents through a series of six history lessons. The\nauthors found that this electronic medium provided a\nsupportive environment and a meaningful forum for\n“active student participation, encouraging students to\ntake responsibility for their own learning” (p.383).\nThese previous studies point to the importance of\nsmall group learning opportunities as good teaching\npractice. However, this particular approach has been\nslow to reach post-secondary education (De Kock,\nSleegers, & Voeten, 2004; Koljatic & Kuh, 2001),\nwhich continues to rely heavily on the lecture format\nand reward individual success. Recent studies\ndemonstrate, however, that cooperative group activities\nare well received by the majority of university students.\nFor example, Peterson and Miller (2004) surveyed\nundergraduate educational psychology students who\nparticipated in cooperative learning and large group\ninstruction regarding their perceptions of these\nexperiences. The study found that the students were\nmore engaged during cooperative learning and\nperceived that their learning task during cooperative\nlearning was more important. Hancock (2004)\nadditionally showed that the cooperative learning\nformat benefited even those who voiced a preference\nfor working alone. Moreover, modern technology as\nused in university coursework has proven adaptable to\nand beneficial for collaborative learning activities, as\nevidenced by the peer scaffolding identified by Pifarre\nand Cobos (2010) during a 12 month electronic\ndiscussion board learning project.\nIt is interesting to note that some K-12 and\nuniversity educators have expanded the collaborative\nlearning model by teaching metacognitive skills",

        "text": "<div><div><figure></figure><p>The term autopoiesis (self-creation) is a neologism coined in 1972 by Varela and Maturana, Chilean cellular biologists and systems theorists, to describe the capacity of living cells to reproduce and organise themselves. The term was picked up and deployed by Niklas Luhmann (1927 – 1998), a German sociologist and philosopher, to capture his conception of society as composed of closed systems of self-referential communication that constantly reproduce and evolve themselves via the repetition of their own operations. When used in reference to social phenomena, autopoiesis is usually deployed as a short-hand reference to Luhmann’s theory of society. This post outlines the concept and its place in systems theory. Its critical potential for law is discussed via two recently published examples, and its limitations are expressed vis a vis the turn to ecological thought. </p><p>Luhmann’s systems theory provides a general theory of society intended to replace the epistemic inheritance usually assumed by sociology. Concepts like subject and object, material and ideal, being and non-being – concepts based on ontological substance, derived from philosophy, law, and religion, cannot, for Luhmann, adequately describe contemporary society. The theory is an entirely artificial edifice. Autopoiesis is non-historical, it did not begin one fine day, it has no origin point and does not need one. Logically speaking the whole project is paradoxical: it aims to produce a universal framework for observation that takes account of the fact that universal observation is impossible. It doesn’t claim that this is how society ‘really’ is – the ontological status of the modern world is overwhelming complexity, or noise – but it makes the (modest?) claim that it is the best way of observing it; indeed, that the capacity to describe itself through systems theory is itself an autological achievement of the evolution of science. In modern society, there is no Archimedean point: all observations are open to dispute, all agreements are agreed to be provisional and contingent, time itself is an open horizon running infinitely into the infinitely explorable past and a risky, uncertain future. Nevertheless, sensible communication about the world remains possible. Complexity is reducible into meaningful statements and collective decisions and is generative of stable expectations and structures. That ongoing achievement is what social systems theory can explain. </p><p>An autopoietic system produces itself while simultaneously producing its own conditions, both internal and external. Systems thus always exist in an ‘environment’. The environment is not the ontic ‘real’ but rather is produced from within as the result of observing and reducing the complexity of its surroundings. Therefore the ‘environment’ of a system does not pre-exist the system but depends on its capacity for sensing and observing. The boundary between a system and its environment is ultimately decided by the system itself and is potentially open to change with each operation. Hence a system cannot interact directly with its environment and can only observe it via self-reference. Systems have “operational closure”, only operating with their own operative codes, programmes, and memory. </p><p>Notoriously, autopoiesis is considered a ‘post-human’ social theory as it is one without people involved. This is not quite true. The theory is indeed anti-Aristotelian, but besides social systems it includes autopoietic living systems (cells, neurological systems, immune systems, etc.) and autopoietic psychic systems (the conscious and unconscious processes of the mind). At any given moment we are composed of elements all three types of system: a living, breathing, self-regenerating body; a conscious mind; and an array of socially-defined subject positions – son, daughter, worker, voter, student, customer, owner, and so forth. The systems are interdependent. Each can affect the others, contingently, and yet they must all be co-ordinated to different degrees to accomplish any task. Yet only communication is social. It is the medium within which social systems produce themselves, define their environment, and establish the conditions for future action. Society is nothing more or less than the communications produced by social systems. Society is communication. </p><p>As systems are self-referential and closed, ‘communication’ is never just straightforward information transfer. We are all faced by the problem of ‘double contingency’ – no one can know what the other really thinks or wants, and each must anticipate and modulate their communication accordingly. In simplified terms, systems emerge. Ego A selects ‘information’ from its environment and ‘utters’ it, to Alter-ego B. Communication begins. A cannot know how B will understand (or misunderstand) the selected information; moreover, understanding does not necessarily imply acceptance. If A wants B to accept the information, A will consider, with reference to experience and present perception, how the utterance should be made to be acceptable to B. In considering the information, B may understand it not as A intended, and may choose to reject or accept the communication regardless of any difference in understanding. Strategies for containing the possible horizon of (mis)understanding emerge with repetition in time, and these stabilise into systems of communication. </p><p>As Luhmann puts it, “(c)ommunications are not ‘living’ units, they are not ‘conscious’ units, they are not ‘actions’. Their unity requires a synthesis of three selections: namely, information, utterance and understanding (including misunderstanding). This synthesis is produced by a network of communication, not by inherent power of consciousness, or by the inherent quality of the information.”<a href=\"applewebdata://1992C9A1-465C-4FC2-BDB3-68ECF8D9E4F1#_ftn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The tripartite synthesis of information, utterance and understanding must be “recreated from situation to situation by referring to previous communications and to possibilities of further communications which are to be restricted by the actual event”.<a href=\"applewebdata://1992C9A1-465C-4FC2-BDB3-68ECF8D9E4F1#_ftn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The selections of further communication are “either an acceptance or rejection of previous communication or a visible avoidance or adjournment of the issue.”<a href=\"applewebdata://1992C9A1-465C-4FC2-BDB3-68ECF8D9E4F1#_ftn3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a><sup> </sup>It follows that, first, neither ego nor alter has control of communication. Communication is not linear information transfer, but an emergent phenomenon premised on the capacity of observers to make observations. We can thus make sense of an otherwise tautological statement: <em>only communication communicates</em>. Second, observation always inscribes a difference in the world and that difference functions by reducing complexity, narrowing the horizon of possible future observations. Third, communication is premised on observation as the marking of one side of a distinction and not the other. Understanding (or misunderstanding) decides the asymmetric difference between what is ‘marked’ in an observation and what goes unmarked – for instance, being and not non-being, having a property and not not-having a property, the human and non-human, and so on. </p><p>The marked side is where the problem of the next observation proceeds from. The unmarked side remains unspoken, but always leaves open the potential for what went unsaid in the structure of the situation to later be recuperated in further observation. This, mirroring the insights of deconstruction, implies that all observation is founded on a paradox. The unity of the difference of the positive and the negative sides of a distinction cannot be observed at once. The ‘whole’ as such is unspeakable. One must split the whole into parts – the marked and the unmarked side – to make any observation at all, at which point the unity of the whole becomes unobservable. This paradox makes the unobservability of the world observable via an operation of observation which itself is unobservable as it occurs. Only later, through second-order observation, can any past observation be observed as such – and then, only contingently, partially, and paradoxically. This is by no means a dialectical point. Paradoxes must simply be unfolded in time, there is no alternative. This is what Luhmann playfully calls the ‘reconstruction of deconstruction’.<a href=\"applewebdata://1992C9A1-465C-4FC2-BDB3-68ECF8D9E4F1#_ftn4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Yet that too is a paradox because each exposition of a paradoxical operation requires a further paradoxical operation, a further event that disappears in the moment of its appearance, an inherently unstable operation that paradoxically gives a system its stability. Systems can only continue to use their operations in order to continue to use their operations in order to continue to use their operations… and this is autopoiesis. </p><p>Much like psychoanalysis, then, systems theory recognises that contingency, misunderstanding, misrecognition, conflict, and disappointment are inherent elements of society, which is founded on observation of the same (understanding) via the production of irreducible differences. It cannot be otherwise, “if the system were set up to produce consensus, it would come to an end”.<a href=\"applewebdata://1992C9A1-465C-4FC2-BDB3-68ECF8D9E4F1#_ftn5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Differences are not problems for society so much as its precondition: they provide the opportunity for ever-more communication, the autopoietic animus that prompts systems to constantly adapt and thus to continue communication. Indeed, society has evolved function systems that handle these paradoxes of knowing the unknowable, dealing with a reality that is always a construction of worlds that are never quite ‘there’.

I propose that only a definition focused on representational abilities allows the prediction of specific behavioural traits that enable us to distinguish recursion from non-recursive iteration and from hierarchical embedding: only subjects able to represent recursion, i.e. to represent different hierarchical dependencies (related by parenthood) with the same set of rules, are able to generalize and produce new levels of embedding beyond those specified <em>a priori</em> (in the algorithm or in the input). The ability to use such representations may be advantageous in several domains: action sequencing, problem-solving, spatial navigation, social navigation and for the emergence of conventionalized communication systems. The ability to represent contiguous hierarchical levels with the same rules may lead subjects to expect unknown levels and constituents to behave similarly, and this prior knowledge may bias learning positively. Finally, a new paradigm to test for recursion is presented. Preliminary results suggest that the ability to represent recursion in the spatial domain recruits both visual and verbal resources. Implications regarding language evolution are discussed.</p>\n<section><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> recursion, hierarchy, embedding, representation, language</p></section></section><section><h2>1. Introduction</h2>\n<p>Recursion is one of the most controversially discussed terms in the cognitive sciences. Although it has been hypothesized as a human-unique trait and as a necessary capacity for the evolution of language [<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C1\">1</a>], the multiplicity of definitions being used [<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C2\">2</a>–<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C6\">6</a>] has undermined the broader interpretation of empirical results [<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C7\">7</a>]. One of the major problems that stems from this multiplicity is the difficulty in drawing boundaries between recursion and similar processes such as cognitive grouping, hierarchical embedding and iteration [<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C8\">8</a>].</p>\n<p>Although there has been a proliferation of literature arguing for and against the claim of recursion as uniquely human [<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C2\">2</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C8\">8</a>–<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C14\">14</a>], the debate remains unresolved. Some empirical paradigms have been considered relevant to address the topic [<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C15\">15</a>–<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C18\">18</a>] but because they fail to capture the distinction between recursion and hierarchical embedding, over-interpreting the results may be misleading [<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C12\">12</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C19\">19</a>].</p>\n<p>Given that brain computations are opaque to observers (until behavioural correlates have been found), definitions focused on algorithmic properties (such as ‘a recursive function is one that calls itself’) may not be entirely relevant for empirical research. On the other hand, isolated analyses of signals (such as vocalizations, social interactions, etc.) may be misleading because not all structures that can modelled using recursion are produced by recursive processes, neither are these structural properties necessarily perceived by observers.</p>\n<p>To overcome these difficulties, I propose that only a definition focused on representational abilities such as ‘the ability to represent self-similarity across hierarchical levels’ enables the prediction of recursion-specific behavioural traits: if a subject is able to represent different hierarchical levels, i.e. different hierarchical nodes related by ‘parenthood’ (in the graph theory sense), with the same set of rules, then he or she may be able to generalize and generate new levels of embedding (‘child’ nodes) beyond those specified <em>a priori</em> (whether in the algorithm or in the input).</p>\n<p>Defined as such, recursion may provide advantages to its users in the domains that it is available: it may provide prior knowledge regarding new or unknown hierarchical levels; and if shared by a population, then it may contribute to the establishment of communicative conventions. Here, it is important to make explicit that we analyse recursion as a kind of representational abstraction without considering how it could be implemented in the brain. Recursion could be a single module recruited by different modalities or it can be an umbrella term referring to a set of mechanisms that operate independently in different domains, each with its own specific constraints. The empirical research essential to support any of these hypotheses has been delayed by the shortage of tools to assess the use of recursion in non-linguistic domains.</p>\n<p>Under this framework, a new paradigm to test for recursion in the visuo-spatial domain will be presented. Given that it can be applied independently of language and in a non-serialized modality, it has the potential to provide insights into the relationship between recursion and language in the evolutionary history.</p></section><section><h2>2. Recursion: from operation to structure</h2>\n<p>As pointed out by Fitch [<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C7\">7</a>], recursion has been many things to many people. Some definitions focus on the characterization of recursive computations; others attempt to describe which structures can be considered recursive.</p>\n<p>In modern computer science, a recursive function is one that calls itself, or one that is defined in terms of itself [<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C7\">7</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C10\">10</a>].

Implications regarding language evolution are discussed.</p>\n<section><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> recursion, hierarchy, embedding, representation, language</p></section></section><section><h2>1. Introduction</h2>\n<p>Recursion is one of the most controversially discussed terms in the cognitive sciences. Although it has been hypothesized as a human-unique trait and as a necessary capacity for the evolution of language [<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C1\">1</a>], the multiplicity of definitions being used [<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C2\">2</a>–<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C6\">6</a>] has undermined the broader interpretation of empirical results [<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C7\">7</a>]. One of the major problems that stems from this multiplicity is the difficulty in drawing boundaries between recursion and similar processes such as cognitive grouping, hierarchical embedding and iteration [<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C8\">8</a>].</p>\n<p>Although there has been a proliferation of literature arguing for and against the claim of recursion as uniquely human [<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C2\">2</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C8\">8</a>–<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C14\">14</a>], the debate remains unresolved. Some empirical paradigms have been considered relevant to address the topic [<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C15\">15</a>–<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C18\">18</a>] but because they fail to capture the distinction between recursion and hierarchical embedding, over-interpreting the results may be misleading [<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C12\">12</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20120097C19\">19</a>].</p>\n<p>Given that brain computations are opaque to observers (until behavioural correlates have been found), definitions focused on algorithmic properties (such as ‘a recursive function is one that calls itself’) may not be entirely relevant for empirical research. On the other hand, isolated analyses of signals (such as vocalizations, social interactions, etc.) may be misleading because not all structures that can modelled using recursion are produced by recursive processes, neither are these structural properties necessarily perceived by observers.</p>\n<p>To overcome these difficulties, I propose that only a definition focused on representational abilities such as ‘the ability to represent self-similarity across hierarchical levels’ enables the prediction of recursion-specific behavioural traits: if a subject is able to represent different hierarchical levels, i.e. different hierarchical nodes related by ‘parenthood’ (in the graph theory sense), with the same set of rules, then he or she may be able to generalize and generate new levels of embedding (‘child’ nodes) beyond those specified <em>a priori</em> (whether in the algorithm or in the input).</p>\n<p>Defined as such, recursion may provide advantages to its users in the domains that it is available: it may provide prior knowledge regarding new or unknown hierarchical levels; and if shared by a population, then it may contribute to the establishment of communicative conventions. Here, it is important to make explicit that we analyse recursion as a kind of representational abstraction without considering how it could be implemented in the brain. Recursion could be a single module recruited by different modalities or it can be an umbrella term referring to a set of mechanisms that operate independently in different domains, each with its own specific constraints. The empirical research essential to support any of these hypotheses has been delayed by the shortage of tools to assess the use of recursion in non-linguistic domains.</p>\n<p>Under this framework, a new paradigm to test for recursion in the visuo-spatial domain will be presented. Given that it can be applied independently of language and in a non-serialized modality, it has the potential to provide insights into the relationship between recursion and language in the evolutionary history.</p></section><section><h2>2.

        "text": "EVOLVING THE NARROW LANGUAGE FACULTY: WAS\nRECURSION THE PIVOTAL STEP?\nANNA R. PARKER\nLanguage Evolution and Computation Research Unit, University of Edinburgh,\n40 George Square, Edinburgh, EH8 9LL, Scotland\nA recent proposal (Hauser, Chomsky & Fitch, 2002) suggests that the crucial defining\nproperty of human language is recursion. In this paper, following a critical analysis of\nwhat is meant by the term, I examine three reasons why the recursion-only hypothesis a\ncannot be correct: (i) recursion is neither unique to language in humans, nor unique to our\nspecies, (ii) human language consists of many properties which are unique to it, and\nindependent of recursion, and (iii) recursion may not even be necessary to human\ncommunication. Consequently, if recursion is not the key defining property of human\nlanguage, it should not be granted special status in an evolutionary account of the system.\n1. Introduction\nHauser, Chomsky & Fitch (2002) (henceforth HCF) propose that the human\nlanguage faculty (FL) consists of two types of property. Those which are found\nelsewhere in cognition (either human or non-human) form the broad language\nfaculty (FLB), with those which are unique to language forming the narrow\nlanguage faculty (FLN). This seems an uncontroversial delineation. What is\nmore contentious, is where the dividing line is drawn. By placing only recursion\nin FLN, HCF suggest it is the single defining property of our linguistic abilities.\nA number of interesting questions arise from this proposal. Firstly, wh at is\nmeant by the term ‘recursion’? HCF (and the ensuing rejoinders too) are\nstrikingly vague. We must thus turn to the literature within and outwith our field\nto develop a clear definition. Secondly, is it true that there is nothing else in\nhuman language that is unique to it? Other unique properties would immediately\ninvalidate HCF’s argument. Thirdly, is recursion truly unique to human\nlanguage? For HCF’s recursion-only hypothesis to be upheld, this must be the\ncase. Finally, is it the case that all languages exhibit recursion? A recursion-less\nhuman language would indicate that recursion cannot be the defining property of\nthe system. Echoing Pinker & Jackendoff (2005) (henceforth PJ), this paper\nadds to their criticisms thorough analysis of recursion, examination of its\nuniqueness, and pinpointing of the crux of the recursion-less language argument.\na\nThe recursion-only hypothesis is just that – a hypothesis. The authors do not “…define FLN as\nrecursion by theoretical fiat…” (Fitch, Hauser & Chomsky, 2005:183) (henceforth FHC), and indeed\nin places they seem to retreat to a weaker position. However, as the authors also note, “[t]he contents\nof FLN are to be empirically determined” (ibid: 182). That is precisely the aim of this paper – to use\nempirical data to assess the hypothesis that “ …FLN only includes recursion…” (HCF: 1569).\n2. Defining Recursion\nA survey of the definitions of recursion available in the linguistics literature\nreveals a vagueness not conducive to our assessment. The computer science\nliterature offers a little more formalisation, but in both cases there is little\nconsensus on where to place the burden of explanation; certain definitions\nhighlight the embedded nature of recursive structures, others use recursive\nphrase structure rules as their basis, others simply equate recursion with\nrepetition. The most significant difficulty with definitions of recursion is their\nfailure to make three important distinctions: recursion is not the same as\niteration, recursion is not the same as phrase structure, and there are differing\ntypes of recursion.\nOne merit of the computer science definitions is that they draw our attention\nto an important feature of recursion – its memory requirements. In processing\nrecursion we need to be able to keep track of where to return to once the\nembedded portion of the structure is complete. For this, we need a last-in-first\u0002out type of storage device such as a pushdown stack.\n2.1. Three Crucial Distinctions\nRecursion versus iteration The first of three distinctions crucial in understanding\nrecursion is the difference between recursion and the oft-confused iteration. This\nboils down to a distinction between embedding and repetition. While iteration\nsimply involves repeating an action or object an arbitrary number of times,\nrecursion involves embedding the action or object within another instance of\nitself.\nWhen baking a cake, we might encounter a recipe instruction such as “stir\nthe mix until it becomes smooth”. Following the instruction involves repeating\nsome action over and over again until we reach the terminating condition.\nImportantly, each stirring action does not rely on the previous or the next. This\nis iteration. Once the cake has been baked, serving an equal-sized piece to each\nof sixteen guests involves repeating a cutting action over and over. We first cut\nthe whole cake in half, then cut each half in half, then cut each quarter in half,\nand then cut each eighth in half. Here the process differs from the iterative\nexample in that there is a dependency between actions; the output of each\ncutting action becomes the input to the next. Further, we cannot omit any\nintermediate action and end up with the same result; it is not possible to go from\nhalves to eighths leaving out the step that gives us quarters. This is recursion.\nTail versus nested recursion The second distinction is between tail and nested\nrecursion. The former is illustrated in possessive constructions - (1), and relative\nclause constructions - (2), the latter in centre embeddings - (3).\n(1) John’s brother’s teacher’s book is on the table.\n(2) The man that wrote the book that Pat read in the cafe that Mary owns.\n(3) The mouse the cat the dog chased bit ran.\nWhile tail recursion involves embedding at the edge of a phrase, nested\nrecursion involves embedding in the centre, leaving material on both sides of the\nembedded component. The latter type of embedding produces long-distance\ndependencies. It is these dependencies that, in turn, necessitate a device for\nkeeping track. In processing (3), we must store the subject noun phrases we\nencounter in memory (in the order we find them), retrieving them only (in the\nopposite order) when we reach the verbs with which they are associated.\nTail recursion might appear to be just a case of iteration, given that it looks like\nthe simple repetition of identical phrases. However, consider (4):\n(4) John’s mother loves him.\nThis cannot be analysed as a simple proposition with another NP tacked on the\nfront. Instead, it must be analysed as a sentence with a complex subject NP,\ncontaining within it another NP. This is exactly what Pinker and Bloom (1990)\nwere referring to when they noted that recursion allows us to specify reference\nto an object to an arbitrarily fine level of precision. The iterative analysis of (4)\nis not true to the complex meaning it reflects. In other words, in natural language\nsemantics forces us to analyse iteration and tail recursion differently.\nRecursion versus phrase structure The final important distinction is between\nrecursion and phrase structure, concepts which are often erroneously equated in\nthe linguistics literature. Phrase structure is the hierarchical ordering of phrases\nwithin a sentence. Importantly, a structure may be hierarchical without being\nrecursive. While hierarchy involves phrases embedded within other phrases,\nrecursion involves identical phrases embedded inside each other. Phrase\nstructure is thus required in language for recursion, because we need the\ncapacity to embed before we can embed identical elements, but phrase structure\ndoes not guarantee recursion.\nWe are now in a position to define recursion (and iteration) as follows:\nIteration : the simple unembedded repetition of an action or object an arbitrary\nnumber of times.\nRecursion : the embedding at the edge or in the centre of an action or object one\nof the same type. Further, nested recursion leads to long-distance dependencies\nand the need to keep track, or add to memory.\n3. The Uniqueness of Recursion\nArmed with a better understanding of recursion, we can turn to the next\nquestion: is recursion unique? HCF define FLN as that which is unique to\nlanguage and unique to humans. If recursion fits this characterisation, there are\nthree places we should not find it: human non-linguistic cognition, non-human\nnon-communicative cognition, and non-human communicative cognition.\n3.1. Human Non-Linguistic Cognition\nWithin the non-linguistic cognition of our species, a number of domains suggest\nthemselves. Number is a reasonable possibility, but this should be ruled out as\nlanguage and number may be evolutionarily linked (PJ, Chomsky, 1988,\nHurford, 1987). In the visual domain, processes responsible for decomposition\nof complex objects and scenes may work in a recursive fashion, analogously to\nthe earlier cake-cutting example. In social cognition, our theory of mind allows\nus to embed minds within minds - I can think that John thinks that Bill thinks\nthat Mary thinks X. This is only possible with a complex conceptual structure\ncapable of generating recursive propositions.\nMusic, like language, is organised hierarchically. However, ascertaining if a\npiece consisting of repeated phrases should be analysed iteratively or recursively\nwill be very difficult. In language, semantics provides a pointer to structure, but\nin music there is no such pointer. Nevertheless, music offers more definitive\nevidence of recursion. Hofstadter (1980) suggests that on encountering a key\nchange, the listener must store the tonic key in memory. Once the tonic key is\nresolved, the stack item can be popped off. In other words, there is a nesting of\none musical key within another. Bach’s “Little Harmonic Labyrinth”, so called\nbecause its key modulations are so frequent and so complex that the listener is\nleft confused as to where they are in relation to the tonic key, suggests a parallel\nwith di",
        "html": "EVOLVING THE NARROW LANGUAGE FACULTY: WAS\nRECURSION THE PIVOTAL STEP?\nANNA R. PARKER\nLanguage Evolution and Computation Research Unit, University of Edinburgh,\n40 George Square, Edinburgh, EH8 9LL, Scotland\nA recent proposal (Hauser, Chomsky & Fitch, 2002) suggests that the crucial defining\nproperty of human language is recursion. In this paper, following a critical analysis of\nwhat is meant by the term, I examine three reasons why the recursion-only hypothesis a\ncannot be correct: (i) recursion is neither unique to language in humans, nor unique to our\nspecies, (ii) human language consists of many properties which are unique to it, and\nindependent of recursion, and (iii) recursion may not even be necessary to human\ncommunication. Consequently, if recursion is not the key defining property of human\nlanguage, it should not be granted special status in an evolutionary account of the system.\n1. Introduction\nHauser, Chomsky & Fitch (2002) (henceforth HCF) propose that the human\nlanguage faculty (FL) consists of two types of property. Those which are found\nelsewhere in cognition (either human or non-human) form the broad language\nfaculty (FLB), with those which are unique to language forming the narrow\nlanguage faculty (FLN). This seems an uncontroversial delineation. What is\nmore contentious, is where the dividing line is drawn. By placing only recursion\nin FLN, HCF suggest it is the single defining property of our linguistic abilities.\nA number of interesting questions arise from this proposal. Firstly, wh at is\nmeant by the term ‘recursion’? HCF (and the ensuing rejoinders too) are\nstrikingly vague. We must thus turn to the literature within and outwith our field\nto develop a clear definition. Secondly, is it true that there is nothing else in\nhuman language that is unique to it? Other unique properties would immediately\ninvalidate HCF’s argument. Thirdly, is recursion truly unique to human\nlanguage? For HCF’s recursion-only hypothesis to be upheld, this must be the\ncase. Finally, is it the case that all languages exhibit recursion? A recursion-less\nhuman language would indicate that recursion cannot be the defining property of\nthe system. Echoing Pinker & Jackendoff (2005) (henceforth PJ), this paper\nadds to their criticisms thorough analysis of recursion, examination of its\nuniqueness, and pinpointing of the crux of the recursion-less language argument.\na\nThe recursion-only hypothesis is just that – a hypothesis. The authors do not “…define FLN as\nrecursion by theoretical fiat…” (Fitch, Hauser & Chomsky, 2005:183) (henceforth FHC), and indeed\nin places they seem to retreat to a weaker position. However, as the authors also note, “[t]he contents\nof FLN are to be empirically determined” (ibid: 182). That is precisely the aim of this paper – to use\nempirical data to assess the hypothesis that “ …FLN only includes recursion…” (HCF: 1569).\n2.

Introduction</h2>\n<p>Some argue DNA’s discovery to have been 145 years ago, with the more recognized discovery being 70 years ago, thanks to the works of Avery, MacLeod, McCarty, Watson, and Crick [<a href=\"#B1-biology-03-00670\">1</a>]. Since then, over a million published works can be found on the subject of DNA, which is the instructions manual of life [<a href=\"#B2-biology-03-00670\">2</a>]. DNA encodes our genes (also known as the genotype) and has been completely sequenced in the “Human Genome Project” as of 2003 [<a href=\"#B3-biology-03-00670\">3</a>]. Genes however are not always expressed, DNA is not always transcribed into ribonucleic acid (RNA), and RNA is not always translated into proteins. This complex network of gene regulation can partly be explained by epigenetics. The term was first coined in 1942 by Conrad Waddington, defining it as “<em>causal interactions between genes and their products which bring the phenotype into being</em>”. Epigenetics represents the many inheritable chemical “marks” found on and surrounding the genome that influence gene expression in a controlled and selective manner. DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are two epigenetic mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression [<a href=\"#B4-biology-03-00670\">4</a>]. DNA methylation was initially found and extensively studied in prokaryotic DNA since the 1960s. In 1977, 5-methylcytosine (5mC) was identified in eukaryotic DNA by Razin and Cedar [<a href=\"#B5-biology-03-00670\">5</a>,<a href=\"#B6-biology-03-00670\">6</a>,<a href=\"#B7-biology-03-00670\">7</a>]. Since their discovery, close to 33,000 published works can be found on DNA methylation, forever changing genetic and chromatin based research [<a href=\"#B8-biology-03-00670\">8</a>].</p>\n<p>Epigenetic changes play a major role in biological processes at the level of chromatin structure and organization. DNA is packaged in the nucleus as a 10 nm diameter nucleosomal fiber (chromatin) and in higher-order chromatin structures, with the basic repeating unit being the nucleosome in which DNA is wrapped around a core of histone proteins. Access to DNA by various cellular machineries is granted by a series of epigenetic processes that change the high-order structure of chromatin. These epigenetic processes often entail dynamic chemical modifications to DNA or to the histones. Chemical modifications of histones include enzymatic methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation [<a href=\"#B9-biology-03-00670\">9</a>]. The addition of an acetyl group on a histone (predominantly on the N-terminal tail) is performed by lysine acetyltransferases (KATs), whereas its removal is performed by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Acetylation of histones generally allows for an “open” state of chromatin (termed euchromatin), exposing DNA and allowing transcription to occur. Methylation of histones may be either an activating or a silencing mark, depending on the specific amino acid affected. Interestingly there is “cross-talk” among the histone PTMs and DNA methylation/demethylation machinery, which is mediated by proteins that bind to the proteins involved in these modifications. For example, histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3; an active mark) located at the 5' end of genes binds to recruit tumor suppressor inhibitor of growth protein 1b, which interacts with growth arrest and DNA damage protein 45a (GADD45) [<a href=\"#B10-biology-03-00670\">10</a>]. GADD45 mediates gene-specific DNA demethylation by recruiting DNA repair enzymes. The trimethylated H3K4 mark also recruits KATs, which result in nucleosomes with this mark having an increased steady state level of histone acetylation and reduced level of 5mC [<a href=\"#B11-biology-03-00670\">11</a>,<a href=\"#B12-biology-03-00670\">12</a>].</p>\n<p>Collectively, DNA methylation is a critical player in many biological aspects, which are not limited to gene expression regulation. The knowledge on DNA methylation is rapidly advancing, and thorough understanding of its diverse functions is required to decipher the mechanisms by which alterations in DNA methylation contribute to human development and diseases. In this review we summarize several important topics in relation to the role of DNA methylation in biology and human diseases. In the second section of the review we will discuss how DNA methyl modifications are generated and relative locations of these modifications within the genome. In the third section, the role of DNA methylation and the role of two important DNA methylation-associated epigenetic modulators MeCP2 and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in different biological processes will be discussed. In the fourth section, we will talk about the different types of methyl binding proteins (MBPs) and their role in DNA methylation-related biological processes and how alterations in DNA methylation and MBPs contribute to human diseases. This section will be followed by a detailed discussion on the effects of teratogens on DNA methylation in the brain, as well as the association of DNA methylation and neurodevelopmental disorders. In the finalsection, we will briefly evaluate the potential of DNA methylation as a biomarker for human diseases.</p></section><section><h2>2. DNA Methylation</h2>\n<section><h3>2.1. Five-Methylcytosine: “The Fifth Base”</h3>\n<p>DNA methylation is the focus of this review and represents “<em>the inheritable changes in gene expression that do not involve DNA sequence changes</em>” [<a href=\"#B4-biology-03-00670\">4</a>]. DNA methylation plays biological roles in genomic imprinting, reprogramming and stability, cellular differentiation, X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), transposon silencing, RNA splicing, and DNA repair [<a href=\"#B13-biology-03-00670\">13</a>,<a href=\"#B14-biology-03-00670\">14</a>,<a href=\"#B15-biology-03-00670\">15</a>]. The family of enzymes responsible for the covalent addition of the methyl group on the fifth carbon of cytosine (considered the “Fifth Base”) are DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), with the methyl group donor generally being <em>S</em>-adenosyl methionine (SAM) (<a href=\"#biology-03-00670-f001\">Figure 1</a>). DNMT1, which is found in undifferentiated and differentiated cells, contributes to the maintenance of DNA methylation during cellular replication when both strands of DNA are separated and copied. DNMT1 preferentially binds to hemi-methylated DNA and copies the DNA methylation of the parental strand to newly replicated strand [<a href=\"#B16-biology-03-00670\">16</a>,<a href=\"#B17-biology-03-00670\">17</a>,<a href=\"#B18-biology-03-00670\">18</a>]. The <em>de novo</em> DNMTs are DNMT3A, DNMT3B and co-factor DNMT3L (DNA methyltransferase-like protein), which methylate DNA during embryogenesis and in differentiated cells, and are highly expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). DNMT3B is essential for early embryogenesis, while DNMT3A is needed late in embryogenesis and found in differentiated cells. DNMT3L lacks a catalytic domain and is proposed to play the role of co-factor, enabling the <em>de novo</em> methylation function of DNMT3A and DNMT3B [<a href=\"#B16-biology-03-00670\">16</a>]. Because epigenetic marks are inheritable, the classic DNA methylation model labels DNMT1 as the enzyme which transfers the established DNA methylation patterns from the parental strand onto the daughter strands, therefore allowing the inheritance to occur and be subsequently maintained [<a href=\"#B18-biology-03-00670\">18</a>]. When DNMT1 does not effect this process, due to its absence from the nucleus, it is termed “<em>passive demethylation</em>” [<a href=\"#B15-biology-03-00670\">15</a>,<a href=\"#B19-biology-03-00670\">19</a>]. However, this model has recently been contested [<a href=\"#B20-biology-03-00670\">20</a>]. DNMT3A/B are gradual acting and highly expressed in somatic cells while their co-factor DNMT3L is not. This suggests that DNMT3L drives the <em>de novo</em> function of DNMT3A/B during embryogenesis only, while in somatic cells, DNMT3L is not expressed, and so DNMT3B actually stimulates DNMT3A. Once stimulated, DNMT3A/B anchor themselves to nucleosomes with DNA methylation, which is said to promote protein stability. Hypomethylation of nucleosomes disables the anchoring of DNMT3A/B, with the free DNMT3A/B being rapidly degraded. This is said to ",

Interestingly there is “cross-talk” among the histone PTMs and DNA methylation/demethylation machinery, which is mediated by proteins that bind to the proteins involved in these modifications. For example, histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3; an active mark) located at the 5' end of genes binds to recruit tumor suppressor inhibitor of growth protein 1b, which interacts with growth arrest and DNA damage protein 45a (GADD45) [<a href=\"#B10-biology-03-00670\">10</a>]. GADD45 mediates gene-specific DNA demethylation by recruiting DNA repair enzymes. The trimethylated H3K4 mark also recruits KATs, which result in nucleosomes with this mark having an increased steady state level of histone acetylation and reduced level of 5mC [<a href=\"#B11-biology-03-00670\">11</a>,<a href=\"#B12-biology-03-00670\">12</a>].</p>\n<p>Collectively, DNA methylation is a critical player in many biological aspects, which are not limited to gene expression regulation. The knowledge on DNA methylation is rapidly advancing, and thorough understanding of its diverse functions is required to decipher the mechanisms by which alterations in DNA methylation contribute to human development and diseases. In this review we summarize several important topics in relation to the role of DNA methylation in biology and human diseases. In the second section of the review we will discuss how DNA methyl modifications are generated and relative locations of these modifications within the genome. In the third section, the role of DNA methylation and the role of two important DNA methylation-associated epigenetic modulators MeCP2 and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in different biological processes will be discussed. In the fourth section, we will talk about the different types of methyl binding proteins (MBPs) and their role in DNA methylation-related biological processes and how alterations in DNA methylation and MBPs contribute to human diseases. This section will be followed by a detailed discussion on the effects of teratogens on DNA methylation in the brain, as well as the association of DNA methylation and neurodevelopmental disorders. In the finalsection, we will briefly evaluate the potential of DNA methylation as a biomarker for human diseases.</p></section><section><h2>2. DNA Methylation</h2>\n<section><h3>2.1. Five-Methylcytosine: “The Fifth Base”</h3>\n<p>DNA methylation is the focus of this review and represents “<em>the inheritable changes in gene expression that do not involve DNA sequence changes</em>” [<a href=\"#B4-biology-03-00670\">4</a>]. DNA methylation plays biological roles in genomic imprinting, reprogramming and stability, cellular differentiation, X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), transposon silencing, RNA splicing, and DNA repair [<a href=\"#B13-biology-03-00670\">13</a>,<a href=\"#B14-biology-03-00670\">14</a>,<a href=\"#B15-biology-03-00670\">15</a>]. The family of enzymes responsible for the covalent addition of the methyl group on the fifth carbon of cytosine (considered the “Fifth Base”) are DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), with the methyl group donor generally being <em>S</em>-adenosyl methionine (SAM) (<a href=\"#biology-03-00670-f001\">Figure 1</a>). DNMT1, which is found in undifferentiated and differentiated cells, contributes to the maintenance of DNA methylation during cellular replication when both strands of DNA are separated and copied. DNMT1 preferentially binds to hemi-methylated DNA and copies the DNA methylation of the parental strand to newly replicated strand [<a href=\"#B16-biology-03-00670\">16</a>,<a href=\"#B17-biology-03-00670\">17</a>,<a href=\"#B18-biology-03-00670\">18</a>]. The <em>de novo</em> DNMTs are DNMT3A, DNMT3B and co-factor DNMT3L (DNA methyltransferase-like protein), which methylate DNA during embryogenesis and in differentiated cells, and are highly expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). DNMT3B is essential for early embryogenesis, while DNMT3A is needed late in embryogenesis and found in differentiated cells. DNMT3L lacks a catalytic domain and is proposed to play the role of co-factor, enabling the <em>de novo</em> methylation function of DNMT3A and DNMT3B [<a href=\"#B16-biology-03-00670\">16</a>]. Because epigenetic marks are inheritable, the classic DNA methylation model labels DNMT1 as the enzyme which transfers the established DNA methylation patterns from the parental strand onto the daughter strands, therefore allowing the inheritance to occur and be subsequently maintained [<a href=\"#B18-biology-03-00670\">18</a>]. When DNMT1 does not effect this process, due to its absence from the nucleus, it is termed “<em>passive demethylation</em>” [<a href=\"#B15-biology-03-00670\">15</a>,<a href=\"#B19-biology-03-00670\">19</a>]. However, this model has recently been contested [<a href=\"#B20-biology-03-00670\">20</a>]. DNMT3A/B are gradual acting and highly expressed in somatic cells while their co-factor DNMT3L is not. This suggests that DNMT3L drives the <em>de novo</em> function of DNMT3A/B during embryogenesis only, while in somatic cells, DNMT3L is not expressed, and so DNMT3B actually stimulates DNMT3A. Once stimulated, DNMT3A/B anchor themselves to nucleosomes with DNA methylation, which is said to promote protein stability. Hypomethylation of nucleosomes disables the anchoring of DNMT3A/B, with the free DNMT3A/B being rapidly degraded. This is said to ",

I asked the guide what it meant, and he replied that it could be translated as \"Post no bills.\" One need only be moderately astute to realize that the sign itself is a bill and so violates its own message. </p><p>To prevent such bills from being posted, we might consider posting another sign that says, \"Post no 'Post no bills' bills.\" But this in turn is a bill, so perhaps we need another sign that says, \"Post no 'Post no \"Post no bills\" bills' bills.\" The problem, as I'm sure you now see, is that this process leads to an infinite sequence of signs that would not only cover the gate, but eventually the entire universe, since each bill is longer than the last. Better, perhaps, just to allow people to stick a few bills on the gate.</p><div></div><div><p>The self-referential bills are examples of recursion. Another instance comes from an anonymous parody of the first line of Edward Bulwer-Lytton's infamous novel, <em>Paul Clifford</em>:</p><blockquote>It was a dark and stormy night, and we said to the captain, \"Tell us a story!\" And this is the story the captain told: \"It was a dark and stormy night, and we said to the captain, 'Tell us a story!' And this is the story the captain told: 'It was a dark.…'\" </blockquote><p>In computational terms, recursion is a process that <em>calls</em> itself, or that calls a similar process. In the example of \"Post no bills,\" the sign is, albeit unwittingly, referring to itself, whereas in the parody of Bulwer-Lytton's novel, the story in the story is the same story.</p><p>Alternatively, one can put the definition in dictionary style:</p></div><div></div><div><p>Perhaps it is best not to dwell on this.</p><p>I propose that recursion is a ubiquitous property of the human mind and possibly the principal characteristic that distinguishes our species from all other creatures on the planet. Recursion is a well-known property of language, but I shall argue that the phenomenon applies to a number of other putatively human domains, including \"theory of mind,\" mental time travel, manufacture, the concept of self and possibly even religion.</p></div><div><p>Grammatical rules in language exploit recursion to create the infinite variety of potential sentences that we can utter and understand. Perhaps the simplest example is a sentence that is composed of sentences, according to a rule that might be expressed as</p><p>S → S + S</p><p>where the arrow is a symbol for <em>can be rewritten as,</em> and <em>S</em> stands for <em>sentence</em>. Rewrite rules of this form are a conventional way to show how language is constructed. This particular rule, invoked twice, creates the following sentence, found in A. A. Milne's <em>Winnie the Pooh</em>: \"It rained and it rained and it rained.\" This example, though, is rather trivial, since it simply amounts to repetition, presumably to create a sense that it rained for rather a long time, causing Piglet some ennui.</p><p>Recursion can be much more complex than simple repetition, and it is used in human language to provide qualification or to add complexity to an utterance. For example, we can break sentences down into phrases, and then apply recursive rules to tack phrases onto phrases, or embed phrases within phrases. There are noun phrases (NP), verb phrases (VP) and prepositional phrases (PP).</p><p>On a visit to a publishing house in Hove, England, I was greeted by the publisher with the unlikely sentence \"Ribena is trickling down the chandeliers.\" (Ribena is the brand name of a flavored drink in the United Kingdom, and it was indeed dripping off the light fixtures.) Here, the sentence is first broken down into an NP (\"Ribena\") and a VP (\"is trickling down the chandeliers\"). But the VP is itself composed of a verb (\"is trickling\") plus a PP (\"down the chandeliers\"), which in turn is composed of a preposition (\"down\") plus an NP (\"the chandeliers\"). The sentence can therefore be parsed in terms of the following rewrite rules:</p><blockquote>1. S → NP + VP<br />2. NP → noun<br />3. VP → verb + PP<br />4. PP → preposition + NP </blockquote><p>Applied to more complex sentences, such rules involve recursion. For example, an NP may include aPP<em>,</em> which may in turn include an NP<em>.</em> In principle, one could cycle repeatedly through rules 2 and 4. Had the publisher not been in something of a panic, he might have elaborated: \"Ribena is trickling down the chandeliers onto the carpet beside my desk.\" (There was a nursery upstairs).</p><p>Children quickly learn to appreciate the power of recursion (if not of Ribena), as illustrated by these sentences from the well-known children's story, \"The House That Jack Built\":</p><blockquote>1. This is the house that Jack built. <br />2. This is the malt that lay in the house that Jack built.<br />3. This is the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that Jack built.<br />4. This is the cat that killed the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that Jack built.<br />5. This is the dog that worried the cat that killed the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that Jack built.</blockquote><p>And so it goes on. It is important to understand that this is not simply a matter of adding disconnected elements. New sentences are added progressively at the beginning, and the rest of the sentence increasingly qualifies the noun. In the fourth sentence, for example, the cat in question is precisely the one that killed the rat that ate the malt, and so on. A cat that killed a rat that did not eat the malt that lay in the house that Jack built simply will not do.</p></div><div></div><div><p>The sentences in \"The House that Jack Built\" are examples of what is called <em>end recursion</em>, in which the recursive rule is invoked at the end. The fourth sentence, for example, begins with the sentence \"This is the cat,\" but then the relative clause \"that killed the rat\" is added to qualify the cat. This relative clause mentions a rat, and a further relative clause, \"that ate the malt,\" is added to qualify the rat, and so forth. In principle, recursive elements can be added <em>ad infinitum</em>or until your short-term memory can hold no more.</p><p>Another kind of recursion is <em>center-embedded recursion</em>, in which constituents are embedded within constituents. For example, in the third sentence of \"The House That Jack Built,\" one might wish to make the malt rather than the rat the subject of the sentence, and so embed a relative clause describing the malt into a sentence about the malt: <em>The malt that the rat ate lay in the house that Jack built.</em></p><p>Such embedded phrases, as in this very sentence, are common. But if phrases are embedded in embedded phrases, things can get complicated. For example, let's convert the fourth sentence into one featuring the malt: <em>The malt that the rat that the cat killed ate lay in the house that Jack built.</em> Now try the fifth sentence: <em>The malt that the rat that the cat that the dog worried killed ate lay in the house that Jack built.</em> Are you still following me?</p><p>That last example is perfectly grammatical, but more than one level of center-embedded recursion is hard to follow, for psychological rather than linguistic reasons. Center-embedding requires a memory device, such as a stack of pointers, indicating where to pick up the procedure once an embedded constituent has been completed. This is not so bad if there is just one embedded structure, since a single pointer can be held in memory to show where to pick up the original procedure. With multiple embedding, you need to keep track of several pointers, which can overstretch working memory. Examples of sentences with more than one level of center-embedding are rare in natural discourse.</p><p>In a recent <em>Science</em> article, psychologist Marc D. Hauser of Harvard University and his colleagues suggested that recursion is a basic characteristic that distinguishes human language from all other forms of animal communication. Chimpanzees and bonobos have been taught a form of language, sometimes known as <em>protolanguage,</em> with some of the characteristics of human language, including the use of symbols to represent objects or actions, and some ability to combine symbols to create new meanings. There is no evidence, though, that these apes use these symbols (or combinations of symbols) in recursive fashion, to create anything like the unlimited set of meanings that we humans can create.</p></div><p>Superficially, at least, the songs emitted by some birds seem to have something of the complexity of human language. American ornithologists Jack P. Hailman and Millicent S. Ficken once argued that chickadee calls have a computable syntax and therefore qualify as \"language.\" These calls are made up of four qualitatively distinct sounds, which we may label <em>A, B, C</em> and <em>D</em>. These elements are always in the same order, although any element may be repeated any number of times or may be omitted altogether. The sequences <em>ABCD, B, BD, AAABBCCCD</em> are all legitimate. Although there is considerable variety in such sequences, they do not involve recursion beyond the simple repetition of elements. Unlike human language, the sequences can be specified by what is known as a <em>finite-state grammar</em>, in which the choice of element at any point in the sequence can be specified by the preceding element. Thus <em>B</em> may follow <em>A,</em> or <em>B</em> may be the first in the sequence, but it can never follow <em>C</em> or <em>D</em>. Of course, the birds may well have used more complex rules, but we do not need to suppose more than that they merely stepped from one element to the next, without any appreciation of what went before or what comes after.

For example, let's convert the fourth sentence into one featuring the malt: <em>The malt that the rat that the cat killed ate lay in the house that Jack built.</em> Now try the fifth sentence: <em>The malt that the rat that the cat that the dog worried killed ate lay in the house that Jack built.</em> Are you still following me?</p><p>That last example is perfectly grammatical, but more than one level of center-embedded recursion is hard to follow, for psychological rather than linguistic reasons. Center-embedding requires a memory device, such as a stack of pointers, indicating where to pick up the procedure once an embedded constituent has been completed. This is not so bad if there is just one embedded structure, since a single pointer can be held in memory to show where to pick up the original procedure. With multiple embedding, you need to keep track of several pointers, which can overstretch working memory. Examples of sentences with more than one level of center-embedding are rare in natural discourse.</p><p>In a recent <em>Science</em> article, psychologist Marc D. Hauser of Harvard University and his colleagues suggested that recursion is a basic characteristic that distinguishes human language from all other forms of animal communication. Chimpanzees and bonobos have been taught a form of language, sometimes known as <em>protolanguage,</em> with some of the characteristics of human language, including the use of symbols to represent objects or actions, and some ability to combine symbols to create new meanings. There is no evidence, though, that these apes use these symbols (or combinations of symbols) in recursive fashion, to create anything like the unlimited set of meanings that we humans can create.</p></div><p>Superficially, at least, the songs emitted by some birds seem to have something of the complexity of human language. American ornithologists Jack P. Hailman and Millicent S. Ficken once argued that chickadee calls have a computable syntax and therefore qualify as \"language.\" These calls are made up of four qualitatively distinct sounds, which we may label <em>A, B, C</em> and <em>D</em>. These elements are always in the same order, although any element may be repeated any number of times or may be omitted altogether. The sequences <em>ABCD, B, BD, AAABBCCCD</em> are all legitimate. Although there is considerable variety in such sequences, they do not involve recursion beyond the simple repetition of elements. Unlike human language, the sequences can be specified by what is known as a <em>finite-state grammar</em>, in which the choice of element at any point in the sequence can be specified by the preceding element. Thus <em>B</em> may follow <em>A,</em> or <em>B</em> may be the first in the sequence, but it can never follow <em>C</em> or <em>D</em>. Of course, the birds may well have used more complex rules, but we do not need to suppose more than that they merely stepped from one element to the next, without any appreciation of what went before or what comes after.

However, this framing creates a foundational contra\u0002diction for doing science using the NGSS framework (E. Miller et al., 2018). Miller et al.\n(2018) argue that having a set of practices chosen by others as important to learn and\nexpecting students to mimic those practices does not position students with the power\nto shape the knowledge production and practices of a community. To position students\nas epistemic agents in science classrooms teachers relinquishing epistemic and content\nauthority and learning environments need to include features that would allow students\nto construct, critique, and evaluate claims to collectively build knowledge. In this paper,\nwe present a computational model-based learning environment designed for middle and\nhigh school biology students to build knowledge about a modelled phenomenon and\nstudy their epistemically agentive learning.\nWhile designing new learning environments, it is also important to incorporate theor\u0002etical and methodological advances in different disciplinary domains. There is a signifi\u0002cant disparity between how biologists study biological systems and how high school\nbiology students learn about those systems (Wilensky & Reisman, 2006). Other than\ntechnical advances in molecular biology, one of the significant shifts in contemporary\nresearch in biological sciences is the use of systems theoretical perspectives to understand\nand investigate biological complexity using computational approaches (Kitano, 2002,\n2017). From the molecular level to the cellular level to the organismic level to the\necological level, biological systems can be studied as complex systems comprised of\ninterconnected constituent parts. Agent-based computational models have been demon\u0002strated to be effective in investigating emergent properties of such complex systems\n(Aslan et al., 2018; Dey et al., 2006; Wilensky, 2020) and teaching emergent biological\nphenomena related to population dynamics and evolution and student participation in\ninquiry-based learning (e.g. Wagh et al., 2017).\nWe posit that a computational model of a biological system that is cognitively acces\u0002sible for students to formulate and test their ideas can support doing systems biology in\nepistemically agentive ways. There is a long history of using computational models in\nthe science classroom to teach various complex phenomena ranging from emergent\nproperties of matter because of its particulate nature (Levy & Wilensky, 2009) to\nclimate change (Svihla & Linn, 2012; Vitale et al., 2016) to evolution (Wagh & Wilensky,\n2018; Wilensky & Novak, 2010). Design features of these models and pedagogical\napproaches to using them can support or hinder specific forms of participation\n(Berland & Lee, 2012; Langbeheim & Levy, 2018). Little is known about how specific\ndesign features of such computational models can support student participation in\nknowledge-building practices by positioning them with the epistemic agency. In this\npaper, we present an Emergent Systems Microworlds (ESM)-based learning environment\ndesigned to support students’ epistemic agentive learning of emergent biological\nphenomena. ESMs use agent-based representations which are known to support the\nlearnability of complex systems phenomena and make sense of how system-level aggre\u0002gate patterns emerge because of agent-level properties and interactions (Wilensky &\nPapert, 2010; Wilensky, 2020). We study how cognitive, social, and affective properties\nof agent-based restructuration in the ESM supported students’ epistemic agentive learn\u0002ing as they participated in and shaped knowledge-building practices to make sense of\nemergent phenomena in biology.\n2 S. DABHOLKAR AND U. WILENSKY\nDesign framework\nEmergent Systems Microworlds\nOver the years, scientific communities across the globe have developed experimental\nmodel systems that have affordances to investigate specific aspects of natural phenomena\n(Striedter, 2022). For example, fruitflies’ (Drosophila) chromosomal organisation and\ntheir short life span have made them a model system to study genetics. Similarly, the\norganisation of a small number of neurons in roundworms (C. elegans) is beneficial to\nthe study of neurobiology. We argue that using principles of Learning Sciences compu\u0002tational models can be designed to be pedagogically effective model systems that support\nstudents’ self-driven investigations and therefore their epistemic agency within the con\u0002straints of a classroom. We present Emergent Systems Microworlds (ESMs) as compu\u0002tational model systems for students to investigate a modelled emergent phenomenon.\nESM design combines two design approaches in Learning Sciences, namely agent-based\nmodelling of emergent systems and constructionism (Wilensky, 2001; Papert, 1980). Agent\u0002based representations in ESMs create affordances for learners to engage deeply with emer\u0002gent phenomena (Goldstone & Wilensky, 2008; Wilensky & Reisman, 2006). An ESM is\ndesigned as a microworld using constructionist design principles to mediate students’\nself-driven explorations to investigate various aspects of the represented disciplinary ideas\n(Edwards, 1995; Papert, 1980). An ESM-based curriculum uses an ESM to facilitate such\nstudent engagement in self-directed, interest-driven explorations and investigations. Stu\u0002dents are encouraged to share their findings and participate in teacher-guided reflections\nto collaboratively construct knowledge about the modelled emergent phenomena in an ESM.\nOur design in this paper builds on the earlier work of using agent-based compu\u0002tational models for learning about emergent phenomena (Arastoopour et al., 2020;\nBrady et al., 2015; Blikstein & Wilensky, 2005; Levy & Wilensky, 2009; Sengupta &\nWilensky, 2009; Stieff & Wilensky, 2003; Wagh & Wilensky, 2018; Wilensky, 2003;\nWilensky & Novak, 2010; Wilkerson-Jerde et al., 2015; Wilensky & Rand, 2015). Emer\u0002gent phenomena are the ones in which uncoordinated interactions between autonomous\nagents result in emergent patterns at the system level (Wilensky, 2001). The emergent\nsystems perspective is useful for understanding several natural phenomena ranging\nfrom prey-predator relationships to nectar collection by honeybees, to the kinetic mol\u0002ecular theory (Danish, 2013; Hmelo-Silver & Azevedo, 2006; Klopfer",

We present Emergent Systems Microworlds (ESMs) as compu\u0002tational model systems for students to investigate a modelled emergent phenomenon.\nESM design combines two design approaches in Learning Sciences, namely agent-based\nmodelling of emergent systems and constructionism (Wilensky, 2001; Papert, 1980). Agent\u0002based representations in ESMs create affordances for learners to engage deeply with emer\u0002gent phenomena (Goldstone & Wilensky, 2008; Wilensky & Reisman, 2006). An ESM is\ndesigned as a microworld using constructionist design principles to mediate students’\nself-driven explorations to investigate various aspects of the represented disciplinary ideas\n(Edwards, 1995; Papert, 1980). An ESM-based curriculum uses an ESM to facilitate such\nstudent engagement in self-directed, interest-driven explorations and investigations. Stu\u0002dents are encouraged to share their findings and participate in teacher-guided reflections\nto collaboratively construct knowledge about the modelled emergent phenomena in an ESM.\nOur design in this paper builds on the earlier work of using agent-based compu\u0002tational models for learning about emergent phenomena (Arastoopour et al., 2020;\nBrady et al., 2015; Blikstein & Wilensky, 2005; Levy & Wilensky, 2009; Sengupta &\nWilensky, 2009; Stieff & Wilensky, 2003; Wagh & Wilensky, 2018; Wilensky, 2003;\nWilensky & Novak, 2010; Wilkerson-Jerde et al., 2015; Wilensky & Rand, 2015). Emer\u0002gent phenomena are the ones in which uncoordinated interactions between autonomous\nagents result in emergent patterns at the system level (Wilensky, 2001). The emergent\nsystems perspective is useful for understanding several natural phenomena ranging\nfrom prey-predator relationships to nectar collection by honeybees, to the kinetic mol\u0002ecular theory (Danish, 2013; Hmelo-Silver & Azevedo, 2006; Klopfer",

The early x-ray diffraction results indicated that DNA was composed of two strands of the polymer wound into a helix. The observation that DNA was double-stranded was of crucial significance and provided one of the major clues that led to the Watson-Crick structure of DNA.

Each of these chains is known as a <i>DNA chain</i>, or a <i>DNA strand</i>. <i>Hydrogen bonds</i> between the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4875/\">base</a> portions of the nucleotides hold the two chains together (<a href=\"/books/NBK26821/figure/A598/?report=objectonly\">Figure 4-3</a>). As we saw in Chapter 2 (<a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A165/box/A217/?report=objectonly\">Panel 2-6</a>, pp. 120-121), nucleotides are composed of a five-carbon <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5842/\">sugar</a> to which are attached one or more phosphate groups and a nitrogen-containing base. In the case of the nucleotides in DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose attached to a single phosphate group (hence the name <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5066/\">deoxyribonucleic acid</a>), and the base may be either <i>adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (<a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5198/\">G</a>),</i> or <i>thymine (T)</i>. The nucleotides are covalently linked together in a chain through the sugars and phosphates, which thus form a “backbone” of alternating sugar-phosphate-sugar-phosphate (see <a href=\"/books/NBK26821/figure/A598/?report=objectonly\">Figure 4-3</a>). Because only the base differs in each of the four types of subunits, each polynucleotide chain in DNA is analogous to a necklace (the backbone) strung with four types of beads (the four bases A, C, G, and T).

Moreover, the two ends of the chain will be easily distinguishable, as one has a hole (the 3′ hydroxyl) and the other a knob (the 5′ phosphate) at its terminus.

This polarity in a DNA chain is indicated by referring to one end as the <i>3</i>′ <i>end</i> and the other as the <i>5</i>′ <i>end</i>.</p><p>The three-dimensional structure of <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5084/\">DNA</a>—<b>the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5106/\">double helix</a></b>—arises from the chemical and structural features of its two polynucleotide chains.

The complexities of the mechanisms involved, the rapidly advancing knowledge base, and the specialized language create a daunting environment for learners and a difficult task for instructors. Several features may contribute to difficulties of learning in MCB, such as the “invisible” and “inaccessible” nature of the entities studied (<a href=\"#B22\">Gilbert <em>et al.</em>, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#B19\">Duncan and Reiser, 2007</a>), the necessity of mapping across physical and ontological levels (<a href=\"#B29\">Marbach-Ad and Stavy, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#B18\">Duncan, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#B20\">Duncan and Tseng, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#B35\">Van Mil <em>et al</em>., 2013</a>), and the interrelated and overlapping nature of complex phenomena (<a href=\"#B18\">Duncan, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#B19\">Duncan and Reiser, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#B20\">Duncan and Tseng, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#B35\">Van Mil <em>et al</em>., 2013</a>). However, literature on the nature of knowledge and conceptual change in MCB is less well developed (with notable exceptions, including such work as <a href=\"#B36\">Venville and Treagust, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#B18\">Duncan, 2007</a>). Unanswered questions include: How do students draw connections between ideas to build expert knowledge networks? How do they organize ideas when learning about cellular phenomena? What are the underlying mechanisms of conceptual change that may lead to scientifically non-normative ideas and misconceptions? Building from cognitive learning science theories and the literature describing domain-specific reasoning strategies, we explore undergraduate students’ understanding of foundational MCB principles, specifically the processes of DNA replication, transcription, and translation.</p>\n<p>We propose that the complex nature of MCB requires learners to build highly integrated knowledge networks that are both productively organized and flexibly dynamic to engage in problem solving and explanation building. We hypothesize that learners must integrate pieces of knowledge, manipulate connections between ideas, and build a cohesive view of the relationships between phenomena to truly build understanding of mechanisms in molecular biology. Although much work has been done to characterize the nature of knowledge among novice learners in science (<a href=\"#B23\">Gobbo and Chi, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#B16\">diSessa, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#B39\">Vosniadou and Brewer, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#B34\">Southerland <em>et al.</em>, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#B5\">Chi, 2013</a>) and experts in science (<a href=\"#B6\">Chi <em>et al</em>., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#B28\">Machamer <em>et al</em>., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#B13\">Darden, 2002</a>, <a href=\"#B14\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#B11\">Craver, 2002</a>), we know much less about how scientific knowledge develops as students move through an undergraduate major.</p>\n<p>In this study, we provide a new lens with which to explore undergraduate students’ understanding of concepts within molecular biology courses. By characterizing undergraduate students’ understanding of key molecular principles, using the knowledge-integration approach to conceptual change, we explore the nature of knowledge and the ways in which it is organized by students, productively and unproductively, as they begin to grapple with the complexity of molecular phenomena.</p></section><section><h2>THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</h2>\n<section><h3>The Theory of Knowledge Integration</h3>\n<p>Learning is a dynamic process involving the acquisition of new ideas, the development of connections between ideas, and the reorganization of prior knowledge (<a href=\"#B8\">Clark and Linn, 2003</a>, <a href=\"#B9\">2013</a>). Much research in the learning sciences has focused on conceptual change, the process by which new knowledge is built (<a href=\"#B40\">Özdemir and Clark, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#B51\">Vosniadou, 2013b</a>). The knowledge-integration theory of conceptual change focuses on the ways in which ideas are <em>sorted</em>, <em>connected</em>, and <em>integrated</em>. Knowledge integration is, by definition, the process by which learners not only add new ideas or facts but also sort through connections and move toward developing a cohesive mental model of a phenomenon (<a href=\"#B8\">Clark and Linn, 2003</a>, <a href=\"#B9\">2013</a>). In doing so, one must <em>sort ideas into appropriate categories</em>, and <em>make connections between ideas</em>, thereby <em>integrating ideas to build a network of knowledge</em>. Knowledge integration is also significantly impacted by the amount of instructional time allocated to important topics. <a href=\"#B8\">Clark and Linn (2003)</a> demonstrated that significant enhancement of knowledge integration around foundational concepts in thermodynamics resulted from increased instructional time in middle school classrooms, thereby underscoring the idea that deeper learning takes time.</p>\n<p>A key component of the theory of knowledge integration is that learners must sort through ideas to construct a cohesive view of a phenomenon. Examples of this sorting include the processes of coalescence and differentiation. Coalescence is the process by which two ideas are merged or combined, whereas differentiation involves the splitting of an idea into separate elements (<a href=\"#B9\">Clark and Linn, 2013</a>). For example, combining the ideas of heating and cooling into one model of thermal equilibrium would be the “coalescence” of two previously separate ideas. Alternatively, the separation of heat and energy from the idea of temperature would be “differentiation.” While knowledge integration, including the active sorting and restructuring of ideas, is necessary for building scientific knowledge, not all actions of restructuring, integration, coalescence, and/or differentiation are immediately productive (<a href=\"#B9\">Clark and Linn, 2013</a>). That is, as new connections are made, they may reinforce misconceptions or create non-normative scientific explanations. Non-normative explanations are defined as student ideas that would not be generally accepted by the scientific community, though they may represent logical trains of thought on the part of the student. These are ideas that would typically be considered “incorrect” by an instructor. By contrast, a normative explanation reflects current norms of the scientific community and would generally be considered “correct” by an instructor.</p>\n<p>Another key component of the theory of knowledge integration is the creation of connections between ideas. For example, when learning about “mutations,” students should form connections between this idea and the concepts of “gene” and “evolution.” Some connections made by students are spontaneous and temporary, whereas others are stable and persistent. Additionally, not all connections give rise to scientifically normative ideas, but they can also give rise to conflicting and dissenting ideas within a conceptual ecology (<a href=\"#B9\">Clark and Linn, 2013</a>).</p>\n<p>Possibly the most complex component of the theory of knowledge integration is the integration of ideas to build complex knowledge structures. According to <a href=\"#B9\">Clark and Linn (2013)</a>, at its most basic level, “integration involves creating or reinforcing the connection between two ideas” (p. 522). Along these same lines, when investigating students’ understanding of science at different levels of knowledge integration, <a href=\"#B8\">Clark and Linn (2003)</a> defined a “nuanced” level of understanding in which answers “involve not only the normative ideas but also important connections to other normative ideas or evidence” (p. 459). It is also important to consider that the process of integrating knowledge, including restructuring and reorganizing ideas, leads to complex, dynamic, and emergent knowledge networks (<a href=\"#B3\">Brown, 2013</a>).

Building from cognitive learning science theories and the literature describing domain-specific reasoning strategies, we explore undergraduate students’ understanding of foundational MCB principles, specifically the processes of DNA replication, transcription, and translation.</p>\n<p>We propose that the complex nature of MCB requires learners to build highly integrated knowledge networks that are both productively organized and flexibly dynamic to engage in problem solving and explanation building. We hypothesize that learners must integrate pieces of knowledge, manipulate connections between ideas, and build a cohesive view of the relationships between phenomena to truly build understanding of mechanisms in molecular biology. Although much work has been done to characterize the nature of knowledge among novice learners in science (<a href=\"#B23\">Gobbo and Chi, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#B16\">diSessa, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#B39\">Vosniadou and Brewer, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#B34\">Southerland <em>et al.</em>, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#B5\">Chi, 2013</a>) and experts in science (<a href=\"#B6\">Chi <em>et al</em>., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#B28\">Machamer <em>et al</em>., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#B13\">Darden, 2002</a>, <a href=\"#B14\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#B11\">Craver, 2002</a>), we know much less about how scientific knowledge develops as students move through an undergraduate major.</p>\n<p>In this study, we provide a new lens with which to explore undergraduate students’ understanding of concepts within molecular biology courses. By characterizing undergraduate students’ understanding of key molecular principles, using the knowledge-integration approach to conceptual change, we explore the nature of knowledge and the ways in which it is organized by students, productively and unproductively, as they begin to grapple with the complexity of molecular phenomena.</p></section><section><h2>THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</h2>\n<section><h3>The Theory of Knowledge Integration</h3>\n<p>Learning is a dynamic process involving the acquisition of new ideas, the development of connections between ideas, and the reorganization of prior knowledge (<a href=\"#B8\">Clark and Linn, 2003</a>, <a href=\"#B9\">2013</a>). Much research in the learning sciences has focused on conceptual change, the process by which new knowledge is built (<a href=\"#B40\">Özdemir and Clark, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#B51\">Vosniadou, 2013b</a>). The knowledge-integration theory of conceptual change focuses on the ways in which ideas are <em>sorted</em>, <em>connected</em>, and <em>integrated</em>. Knowledge integration is, by definition, the process by which learners not only add new ideas or facts but also sort through connections and move toward developing a cohesive mental model of a phenomenon (<a href=\"#B8\">Clark and Linn, 2003</a>, <a href=\"#B9\">2013</a>). In doing so, one must <em>sort ideas into appropriate categories</em>, and <em>make connections between ideas</em>, thereby <em>integrating ideas to build a network of knowledge</em>. Knowledge integration is also significantly impacted by the amount of instructional time allocated to important topics. <a href=\"#B8\">Clark and Linn (2003)</a> demonstrated that significant enhancement of knowledge integration around foundational concepts in thermodynamics resulted from increased instructional time in middle school classrooms, thereby underscoring the idea that deeper learning takes time.</p>\n<p>A key component of the theory of knowledge integration is that learners must sort through ideas to construct a cohesive view of a phenomenon. Examples of this sorting include the processes of coalescence and differentiation. Coalescence is the process by which two ideas are merged or combined, whereas differentiation involves the splitting of an idea into separate elements (<a href=\"#B9\">Clark and Linn, 2013</a>). For example, combining the ideas of heating and cooling into one model of thermal equilibrium would be the “coalescence” of two previously separate ideas. Alternatively, the separation of heat and energy from the idea of temperature would be “differentiation.” While knowledge integration, including the active sorting and restructuring of ideas, is necessary for building scientific knowledge, not all actions of restructuring, integration, coalescence, and/or differentiation are immediately productive (<a href=\"#B9\">Clark and Linn, 2013</a>). That is, as new connections are made, they may reinforce misconceptions or create non-normative scientific explanations. Non-normative explanations are defined as student ideas that would not be generally accepted by the scientific community, though they may represent logical trains of thought on the part of the student. These are ideas that would typically be considered “incorrect” by an instructor. By contrast, a normative explanation reflects current norms of the scientific community and would generally be considered “correct” by an instructor.</p>\n<p>Another key component of the theory of knowledge integration is the creation of connections between ideas. For example, when learning about “mutations,” students should form connections between this idea and the concepts of “gene” and “evolution.” Some connections made by students are spontaneous and temporary, whereas others are stable and persistent. Additionally, not all connections give rise to scientifically normative ideas, but they can also give rise to conflicting and dissenting ideas within a conceptual ecology (<a href=\"#B9\">Clark and Linn, 2013</a>).</p>\n<p>Possibly the most complex component of the theory of knowledge integration is the integration of ideas to build complex knowledge structures. According to <a href=\"#B9\">Clark and Linn (2013)</a>, at its most basic level, “integration involves creating or reinforcing the connection between two ideas” (p. 522). Along these same lines, when investigating students’ understanding of science at different levels of knowledge integration, <a href=\"#B8\">Clark and Linn (2003)</a> defined a “nuanced” level of understanding in which answers “involve not only the normative ideas but also important connections to other normative ideas or evidence” (p. 459). It is also important to consider that the process of integrating knowledge, including restructuring and reorganizing ideas, leads to complex, dynamic, and emergent knowledge networks (<a href=\"#B3\">Brown, 2013</a>).

The methods for complexity estimates have been realized in 1990s before the Human genome project (Trifonov <a href=\"#CR118\">1990</a>; Gusev et al. <a href=\"#CR40\">1991</a>; Román-Roldán et al. <a href=\"#CR100\">1998</a>). Information measures and entropies estimates serve as background for biophysical models of genome structure and evolution (Sadovsky et al. <a href=\"#CR102\">2008</a>). The theory of overlapping genetic codes (protein coding triplets, RNA structure signal, nucleosome positioning codes, and topological chromosome codes) started from the works by E.N.Trifonov (Trifonov <a href=\"#CR117\">1989</a>, <a href=\"#CR118\">1990</a>) relies to numerical sequence complexity. With development of the high-throughput sequencing technologies the complexity analysis tools evolved from simple algorithm realization to advanced online programs, large scale genome data processing software (Orlov and Potapov <a href=\"#CR89\">2004</a>; Kryukov et al. <a href=\"#CR65\">2020</a>; Agenis-Nevers et al. <a href=\"#CR4\">2021</a>; Karakatsanis et al. <a href=\"#CR57\">2021</a>; Zimnyakov et al. <a href=\"#CR140\">2023</a>; Bello et al. <a href=\"#CR10\">2023</a>).</p>\n<p>In the next sections of this “<a href=\"#Sec1\">Introduction</a>,” we will discuss applications of the complexity profiling to segmentation and delineation of genome sequences, search for genome repeats and transposable elements, and next-generation sequencing reads. Furthermore, we review the applications of complexity estimates for gene transcription regulatory regions analysis, the alignment-free sequences comparison methods, and the compression-based complexity approaches.</p>\n<p>The rest of the review follow standard scheme—methods and algorithms, results, and discussion. The section “Methods and algorithms for DNA sequence complexity” reviews the algorithms for DNA sequence complexity estimates. The “<a href=\"#Sec12\">Results</a>” section present comparison of the complexity methods on the different sequence sets, online tools for sequence complexity analysis (summarized in the table), discuss low complexity for protein sequences, and the genome database compression methods based on the complexity. The “<a href=\"#Sec17\">Discussion</a>” section summarizes recent findings and actual applications for coronavirus genome analysis.</p>\n<section><h3>Complexity for segmentation and delineation of genome sequences</h3>\n<p>The measures of compositional complexity coming from the statistical physics methods help to find abnormalities in linear genome structure and make corresponding segmentation (Karakatsanis et al. <a href=\"#CR57\">2021</a>; Bernaola-Galván et al. <a href=\"#CR12\">2023</a>). Shannon information (Shannon <a href=\"#CR107\">1948</a>) as the first measure of nucleotide frequencies allows delineation of complexity blocks, coding, and non-coding regions in a sequence (Deng et al. <a href=\"#CR29\">2012</a>). Shannon information, as well as entropy, could be measured for nucleotides, dinucleotides, and oligonucleotides of any reasonable length (up to 10) in available genome sequences. Despite this measure is easy to count, it can separate real and artificial sequences (Sadovsky et al. <a href=\"#CR102\">2008</a>). Chang and colleagues have shown that the Shannon information for sequences from complete genomes are much higher than for random sequences of the same size (Chang et al. <a href=\"#CR17\">2005</a>). This observation raised the problem of artificial sequence generation that resembles properties of real genome sequences (Wang et al. <a href=\"#CR130\">2020</a>).</p>\n<p>Fluctuations in nucleotide frequencies in genome regions allow find heterogeneous sequence regions at varying scale—from short gene regulatory regions (kilobases) to isochores and chromosome segments (megabases) (Bernaola-Galván et al. <a href=\"#CR12\">2023</a>). Thus, applications of complexity analysis could be listed by sequence size:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Short sequences (transcription factor binding sites, promoters, gene regulatory regions, small domains, and microsatellites (Orlov and Potapov <a href=\"#CR89\">2004</a>; Safronova et al. <a href=\"#CR104\">2016</a>).</p></li>\n<li><p>Medium size genome regions (genes, patching exon/intron structures, distal gene enhancers) (Abnizova et al. <a href=\"#CR2\">2007</a>; Deng et al. <a href=\"#CR29\">2012</a>).</p></li>\n<li><p>Chromosome arms, and complete prokaryotic genomes (Agenis-Nevers et al. <a href=\"#CR4\">2021</a>; Bonidia et al. <a href=\"#CR14\">2022</a>; Bernaola-Galván et al. <a href=\"#CR12\">2023</a>).</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The concept of triplet periodicity class and a measure of similarity between such classes were introduced in (Frenkel and Korotkov <a href=\"#CR35\">2008</a>). Triplet periodicity in DNA is related to coding sequence properties. It could be used to find ORF (open reading frame) shifts (Frenkel and Korotkov <a href=\"#CR36\">2009</a>).</p>\n<p>Suvorova et al. (<a href=\"#CR112\">2014</a>) compared periodicity search methods in DNA sequences. It was shown that combination of spectral methods and information decomposition methos is necessary to define hidden periodicities with high mutation rate. Suvorova and Korotkov (<a href=\"#CR111\">2015</a>) studied triplet periodicity differences inside and between genomes extending the approach discussed by Dios et al. (<a href=\"#CR32\">2014</a>).</p>\n<p>Visible elements of low complexity regions in a genome are tandem repeats (Benson <a href=\"#CR11\">1999</a>; Frenkel et al. <a href=\"#CR34\">2017</a>). Such tandem (tail-to-tail) repeats are considered as a kind low complexity region. Tandem consist of tens to hundreds of residues of a repeated pattern, such as <em>atcatcatcatcatc</em> (“<em>atc</em>” repeated). They are classified as mini and microsatellites (Jurka et al. <a href=\"#CR55\">2007</a>). Molecular mechanism of replication slippage lead reproducing of tandem repeats. Tandem duplications are common for cancers (Li et al. <a href=\"#CR73\">2020</a>) and may occur in somatic cells at larger scale. Enrichment of head-to-tail somatic segmental tandem duplications in genome defined as the tandem duplicator phenotype also defines lower sequence complexity (Menghi et al. <a href=\"#CR78\">2018</a>). There are set of computational tools such TRF (Tandem Repeat Finder) (Benson <a href=\"#CR11\">1999</a>; Frenkel et al. <a href=\"#CR34\">2017</a>) and ULTRA (Olson and Wheeler <a href=\"#CR87\">2018</a>) to effectively search for degenerated tandem repeats (Delucchi et al. <a href=\"#CR28\">2021</a>).</p>\n<p>There are set of methods for tandem repeat search—mreps (Kolpakov et al. <a href=\"#CR61\">2003</a>), TRStalker (Pellegrini et al. <a href=\"#CR95\">2010</a>), T-REKS (Jorda and Kajava <a href=\"#CR54\">2009</a>), G-IMEx (Mudunuri et al. <a href=\"#CR81\">2010</a>). The methods for tandem repeat search are limited due to sensitivity to nucleotide deletions and insertions.</p>\n<p>Korotkov et al. (<a href=\"#CR63\">2022</a>) studied triplet and <em>k</em>-mer periodicities in relation to genome adaptation. The grouping of bacterial genomes by periodicity in repeat composition was shown.

PRICE\nAbstract\nThe Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) engage students in the\nepistemic, or knowledge building, components of science through three\u0002dimensional learning. Each scientific domain has its own epistemic aspects\nthat result from different social groups going about science in different ways\nto conceptualize different bodies of knowledge; education researchers rec\u0002ommend that these be included in science education. While the Science &\nEngineering Practices and Crosscutting Concepts of the NGSS apply to all\nsciences, they can be combined in ways that reflect the domain-specific as\u0002pects of the life sciences. In this paper, we define and describe simplified epis\u0002temic themes, or ways of knowing, within the life sciences for educators to\nuse as a guide when creating lessons and units. Then, we outline example\nPractice-Crosscutting Concept pairs and groups that curriculum developers\ncan use in learning performance statements to reflect these ways of knowing.\nKey Words: NGSS; curriculum development; science education; life sciences; learning\nperformance statement.\nc Introduction\nThe Next Generation Science Standards\n(NGSS; NRC, 2012; NGSS Lead States,\n2013) define statements of student perfor\u0002mance that integrate one Disciplinary Core\nIdea (DCI), one Science & Engineering Prac\u0002tice (Practice), and one Crosscutting Concept\n(CCC). This is the basis of three-dimensional\nlearning (Krajcik et al., 2014).\nThree-dimensional learning engages stu\u0002dents in the epistemic components of the\nscientific process, or the knowledge building\naspects of science (Duschl, 2008; Jiménez\u0002Aleixandre & Crujeiras, 2016; NGSS Lead\nStates, 2013). These include how scientists\nperceive the world, and the methods and cognitive tools that they\nuse in inquiry. Different social groups go about science in different\nways to conceptualize various bodies of knowledge, so each\nscientific domain has their own epistemic aspects (e.g., Erduran\n& Dagher, 2014; Kelly & Licona, 2018; MacLeod, 2018; Stroupe,\n2015). We refer to these as the ways of knowing for each scien\u0002tific domain (after Price, 2023). Some researchers suggest that\nthese domain-specific epistemic aspects are essential for knowledge\nbuilding in science and should be included in science education\nand curriculum development (e.g., Duschl, 2008; Erduran, 2007;\nGoldman et al., 2018; Kelly & Licona, 2018). Further, Kelly and\nLicona (2018) state that “domain-specific epistemic practices neces\u0002sitate different pedagogical methods” (p. 151).\nBest practices for making NGSS-aligned curricular materials\nadvocate for each lesson to have a learning performance statement\n(Krajcik et al., 2014; NSTA, 2014). A lesson will target an NGSS\nperformance expectation as the standard, but the lesson should not\ndirectly teach to that performance expectation. Instead, teachers\nand curriculum developers commonly choose a CCC and/or Prac\u0002tice different from those used for the NGSS performance expecta\u0002tion standard. They then combine the DCI of the standard with\ntheir chosen CCC and Practice to make a new three-dimensional\nlearning statement, referred to as the learn\u0002ing performance statement, that more closely\nmatches what students are doing and learn\u0002ing in their lesson.\nPrice (2023) argues that the domain\u0002specific epistemic aspects of science can be\nincorporated into lessons and units through\nthe choice of Practices and CCCs in the learn\u0002ing performance statements. They detail the\nways of knowing for the Earth & Space Sci\u0002ences and provide Practice-CCC pairs and\ngroups that represent these. In this paper,\nwe extend this idea to the life sciences. We\ndefine domain-specific aspects of biology\nthat represent themes in the ways of knowing in the life sciences.\nThen we propose Practice-CCC pairs and groups to reflect these.\nThe American Biology Teacher, Vol. 86, No. 5, pp. 274–280, ISSN 0002-7685, electronic ISSN 1938-4211. © 2024 by National Association of Biology Teachers.

We summarize these below.\nMultiple Modes of Inquiry\nBiological investigations involve the study of life over a range of\ntemporal and spatial scales and processes that occur in cycles and\nwithin systems. This broad range requires different investigation\nmethods, or modes of inquiry. Laboratory-based or controlled vari\u0002able experiments are relevant for present life forms or systems at\ntemporal or spatial scales that can be directly manipulated (Mayr,\n2004). Observational investigations are important for life forms or\nsystems that existed in the past, experienced change over a longer\ntime scale, or that cannot be directly or easily manipulated in the\npresent because of complexity or size (Turner, 2021). In model\u0002based investigations, biologists use conceptual or computational\nmodels to represent and test complex biological systems as well\nas to simulate and manipulate life components not appropriate for\nlaboratory investigation (e.g., too small, ethical concerns) (Takacs\n& Ruse, 2013). Finally, math-based investigations are important for\ndefining, predicting, and understanding change through probabil\u0002ity and statistics, such as for population dynamics, genetics, and\nevolution/cladistics.\nOrder & Classification\nIt is necessary to define, group, and separate aspects of life in order\nto investigate similarities and differences, functions, and relation\u0002ships (Bard & Rhee, 2004). Human brains have a natural ten\u0002dency for organization, to make groupings based on such things\nas similarity, proximity, and continuity (Wagemans et al., 2012).\nUltimately, these orders and classifications must have a scientifically\nmeaningful basis. The evidence-based process of creating and then\nevaluating groupings is an important sense-making step. Discus\u0002sions on the scientific meaning of observational groupings (i.e., per\u0002ceptual organizations) was a point of discussion for early biologists,\nanatomists, and naturalists (e.g., Huxley vs. Darwin; Winsor, 2021).\nBiologists define individual parts of systems so that they can inves\u0002tigate the features and functions of each part and interrelationships\namong parts (Frost & Kluge, 1994). Classifications help to define\nand contextualize similarities and differences among the units of\nlife, such as species and populations, which is important for docu\u0002menting change through time (Hoehndorf et al., 2015). Finally, the\nact of organizing life and its systems is essential for investigating the\nhierarchical nature of life (Moore, 1993).\nSystems Thinking\nSystems thinking is present in numerous areas of biology. In systems\nthinking, biologists conceptualize aspects of life as interconnected\nparts that have their own characteristics and functions that work\ntogether to contribute to the larger network or entity. Mapping the\ncomponents, relationships, and pathways of the system, includ\u0002ing between scales, helps biologists to both compartmentalize and\nstudy the parts as well as investigate the functioning of the whole\n(Guo, 2006). Biologists use system maps to study the energy and\nmatter transfer within the system. Systems thinking helps biologists\nto conceptualize how the many individual parts work together to\nproduce a result, such as human life functions from smaller-scale\nbiochemical processes and the functioning of an ecosystem (Cha\u0002many et al., 2017). Systems thinking also helps biologists under\u0002stand how instability in those parts leads to change within the larger\nsystem.\nCausal & Functional Relationships\nThe aspects of the living world are commonly viewed through\na causal or functional lens. This shapes how investigations are\ndesigned, models are structured, and data are analyzed. Parts of\na living system or ecosystem serve a function, and that function\nshapes both the nature of the part and the functioning of the whole.\nIf there is a change in a system, then there is some cause for that\neffect. Biologists look for, test for, and explain life relative to these\ncausal and functional relationships (Bard & Rhee, 2004; Turner,\n2021). Once defined, they can look for the mechanisms and drivers\nof those relationships. Applying an understanding of functional and\ncausal relationships allows biologists to deduce past and predict\nfuture change as well as to investigate the reason for instability in a\nsystem (Freese et al., 2003).\nScales & Hierarchy\nScalar thinking in biology is important for understanding life within\nand between different spatial scales and organizational scales ( Jin &\nLiu, 2021). Life systems have parts at the finer scales that progres\u0002sively combine to contribute to the functioning of the system at\nlarger spatial scales (e.g., cells, organs, systems, body) (Chamany\net al., 2017). Because the properties and functions of the parts are\nunique to each spatial scale, a scale-specific perspective is impor\u0002tant when studying each part and how they relate to the whole.\nHierarchy-based organizational scales are a fundamental aspect of\norganizing and classifying life systems. Organizational structure is\nalso important in ecology, wh",

This allows the structure and behaviour of DNA to be studied without the need for complex and time-consuming models, facilitating faster and more accessible research.\n</p>\n<p>\n“This new model can be useful for projects that require studying the DNA’s structure in a detailed and agile way. Although the model is already functional, we are working to improve it and apply it into other components of the cell nucleus, which could open new opportunities in biomedical research”, notes Modesto Orozco, professor at the UB’s Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Detailed genomic information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe research team tested the new tool and validated its potential for obtaining high-speed chromatin simulations. The model allowed the observation of the behaviour of a specific section of DNA in a yeast gene, as well as modelling the structure of DNA in mitochondria and reproducing the flexibility of different 'DNA structures in various contexts. “It was also able to simulate the formation of small circular DNA structures known as <em>minicircles</em>”, says David Farré-Gil, first author of the research and a PhD student in the same lab. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for detailed analysis of DNA and chromatin.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe project was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, the Agency for the Management of University and Research Grants (AGAUR), the Government of Catalonia and the European Union’s Research and Innovation Programme. The study has been carried out in collaboration with the University of Nottingham and has contributed to strengthening collaborations between European research institutions.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Reference article: </strong>Farré-Gil, David; Arcon, Juan Pablo; Laughton, Charles A.; Orozco, Modesto. <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkae444/7685160\">“CGeNArate: a sequence-dependent coarse-grained model of DNA for accurate atomistic MD simulations of kb-long duplexes”</a>. <em>Nucleic Acids Research</em>, May 2024.

They are the most important macromolecules for the continuity of life. They carry the genetic information of a cell and instructions for the functioning of the cell. Nucleic acids are information molecules that serve as blueprints for the proteins that are made by cells. They are also the hereditary material in cells, as reproducing cells pass the blueprints on to their offspring.</p>\n<p>The two main types of nucleic acids are <strong>deoxyribonucleic</strong> <strong>acid</strong> <strong>(DNA)</strong> and <strong>ribonucleic</strong> <strong>acid</strong> <strong>(RNA)</strong>. DNA is the genetic material found in all living organisms. It is found in the nucleus of eukaryotes and in the chloroplasts and mitochondria. In prokaryotes, the DNA is not enclosed in a nucleus.</p>\n<p>The entire genetic content of a cell is known as its <strong>genome</strong>. In eukaryotic cells, DNA forms a complex with histone proteins to form chromatin, the substance of eukaryotic chromosomes. A chromosome may contain tens of thousands of genes. Many genes contain the information to make protein products; other genes code for RNA products. DNA controls all of the cellular activities by turning the genes “on” or “off.”</p>\n<p>The other type of nucleic acid, RNA, is mostly involved in protein synthesis. DNA molecules use an intermediary, called messenger RNA (mRNA), to communicate with the rest of the cell. Other types of RNA, such as rRNA, tRNA, and microRNA, are involved in protein synthesis and its regulation.</p>\n<h2>5.1 | Nucleotides and the Phosphodiester Bond</h2>\n<div>\n<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the three components of nucleotide structure.</li>\n<li>Recognize how nucleotides and nucleic acids are related.</li>\n<li>Name the type of bond that holds nucleotides together &amp; identify it in a nucleic acid structure.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>DNA and RNA are made up of monomers known as <strong>nucleotides</strong>. The nucleotides combine with each other to form a nucleic acid, DNA or RNA. Each nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose (five-carbon) sugar, and a phosphate group (<strong>Figure 5.2</strong>). Each nitrogenous base in a nucleotide is attached to a sugar molecule, which is attached to one or more phosphate groups.</p>\n<figure><figcaption><strong>Figure 5.2</strong> A nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar, and one or more phosphate groups. The sugar is deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The nitrogenous bases are organic molecules that contain nitrogen. They are bases because they contain an amino group that has the potential of binding an extra hydrogen. Each nucleotide in DNA contains one of four possible nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G) cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Each nucleotide in RNA contains one of four possible nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G) cytosine (C), and uracil (U). Adenine and guanine are classified as purines and have two carbon-nitrogen rings. Cytosine, thymine, and uracil are classified as pyrimidines, which have a single carbon-nitrogen ring (<strong>Figure 5.2</strong>).</p>\n<p>The carbon atoms of the pentose sugar molecule in each nucleotide are numbered as 1′, 2′, 3′, 4′, and 5′ (1′ is read as “one prime”). The nitrogenous base is attached to the 1′ carbon and the phosphate group is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5′ carbon. In RNA, the pentose sugar is ribose, which has a hydroxyl group attached to the 2′ carbon. In DNA, the pentose sugar is deoxyribose, which has a hydrogen atoms attached to the 2′ carbon. The “deoxy” in the name of DNA refers to the missing oxygen atom at the 2′ carbon (<strong>Figure</strong><strong> 5.2</strong>).</p>\n<p>Nucleic acids are long, linear chains of nucleotides. <strong>Phosphodiester</strong> <strong>linkages</strong> are covalent bonds between the 3′ carbon of one nucleotide and the 5′ phosphate group of another. They form by dehydration synthesis reactions <strong>(Figure 5.3).</strong> Nucleic acids have directionality: the first nucleotide in the chain has a free phosphate group at the 5′ end of the molecule. The last nucleotide added has a free 3′ hydroxy group at the 3′ end of the molecule. Nucleotides are always added on to the 3′ end.</p>\n<figure><figcaption><strong>Figure 5.3</strong> Covalent bonds that form between nucleotides are called phosphodiester linkages. They are formed by dehydration synthesis reactions when a hydroxyl group is removed from the 3′ carbon of one nucleotide and a hydrogen atom is removed from the hydroxyl group attached to the 5′ carbon of another nucleotide. Water is produced and a phosphodiester bond is formed.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>5.2 | Deoxyribonucleic Acid: DNA</h2>\n<div>\n<p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe the structure and role of DNA.</li>\n<li>Discuss the similarities and differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2>5.2.1 The Double Helix</h2>\n<p>In the 1950s, Francis Crick and James Watson worked together to determine the structure of DNA at the University of Cambridge, England. Other scientists like Linus Pauling and Maurice Wilkins were also actively exploring this field. Pauling had discovered the secondary structure of proteins using X-ray crystallography. In Wilkins’ lab, researcher Rosalind Franklin was using X-ray diffraction methods to understand the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick were able to piece together the puzzle of the DNA molecule on the basis of Franklin’s data because Crick had also studied X- ray diffraction (<strong>Figure 5.4</strong>). In 1962, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Unfortunately, by then Franklin had died, and Nobel prizes are not awarded posthumously.</p>\n<figure><figcaption><strong>Figure 5.4</strong> The work of pioneering scientists (a) James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maclyn McCarty led to our present day understanding of DNA. Scientist RosalindFranklin discovered the X-ray diffraction pattern of DNA, which helped to elucidate its double helix structure. (Credit: modification of work by Marjorie McCarty, Public Library of Science)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Watson and Crick correctly proposed that DNA is made up of two strands that are twisted around each other to form a right-handed helix. Two strands of nucleotides are held together by hydrogen bonds that form between pairs of nitrogenous bases. The sugar and phosphate “backbone” forms the outside of the helix. The nitrogenous bases are stacked in the interior, like the steps of a ladder. The two strands are anti-parallel in nature; that is, the 3′ end of one strand faces the 5′ end of the other strand (<strong>Figure 5.5</strong>).</p>\n<figure><figcaption><strong>Figure 5.5</strong> DNA has (a) a double helix structure and (b) hydrogen bonds. The major and minor grooves are binding sites for DNA binding proteins during processes such as transcription (the copying of RNA from DNA) and replication.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Only certain types of base pairing occur. A can only pair with T, and G can only pair with C, as shown in <strong>Figure 5.5</strong>. This is known as the base complementary rule. In other words, the DNA strands are complementary to each other. If the sequence of one strand is 5′-AATTGGCC-3′, the complementary strand would have the sequence 3′-TTAACCGG-5′. The fact that the two strands of a DNA molecule are complementary allows DNA to replicate. During DNA replication, each strand is copied, resulting in a daughter DNA double helix containing one parental DNA strand and a newly synthesized strand. The base pairs are stabilized by hydrogen bonds; adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds.</p>\n<div>\n<p>A mutation occurs, and cytosine is replaced with adenine. What impact do you think this will have on the DNA structure?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>5.2.2. DNA Packaging in Cells</h2>\n<p>When comparing prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, prokaryotes are much simpler than eukaryotes in many of their features (<strong>Figure 5.6</strong>). Most prokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome that is found in an area of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid.</p>\n<figure><figcaption><strong>Figure 5.6</strong> A eukaryote contains a well-defined nucleus, whereas in prokaryotes, the chromosome lies in the cytoplasm in an area called the nucleoid.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The size of the genome in one of the most well-studied prokaryotes, <em>E. coli</em>, is 4.6 million base pairs (approximately 1.1 mm, if cut and stretched out). So how does this fit inside a small bacterial cell? The DNA is twisted by what is known as supercoiling. Supercoiling means that DNA is either under-wound (less than one turn of the helix per 10 base pairs) or over-wound (more than 1 turn per 10 base pairs) from its normal relaxed state. Some proteins are known to be involved in the supercoiling; other proteins and enzymes, such as DNA gyrase, help in maintaining the supercoiled structure.</p>\n<p>Eukaryotes, whose chromosomes each consist of a linear DNA molecule, employ a different type of packing strategy to fit their DNA inside the nucleus (<strong>Figure 5.7</strong>).

First, we show how the building’s designed emplacement produces an organizational change directed at accelerating the traffic of discoveries and the collaborations across basic research and clinical practice. Second, we focus on the contribution of the NCRC’s internal design (i.e. its laboratory spaces) to a larger spatial, epistemic and social (re)organization of (local) experimental practices of patient-tailored immunotherapies development. Our focus on the articulations of spaces, experimental systems and epistemic socialities allows us to characterize our observations of the NCRC as epistemic dwelling. This notion, we maintain, highlights how the NCRC goes beyond the physical networking of neighboring experimental practices and rather encompasses a generative process of co-habitation of a novel socio-spatial-technical unit of scientific activity.",

Organisms store information as DNA, release or carry information as RNA, and transform information into the proteins that perform most of the functions of cells (for example, some proteins also access and operate the DNA library). This <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology\">“central dogma”</a> of molecular biology is an extremely simplistic model, but useful for following the flow of information in biological systems. Among the core features:</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>1. DNA is the genetic material of all cellular organisms.</strong></p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.microbe.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/cytosine.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Cytosine, a nucleotide</figcaption></figure>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA\">Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</a> is the material substance of inheritance. All cellular organisms use DNA to encode and store their genetic information. DNA is a chemical compound that resembles a long chain, with the links in the chain made up of individual chemical units called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide\">nucleotides</a>. The nucleotides themselves have three components: a sugar (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose\">deoxyribose</a>), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate\">phosphate</a>, and a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleobase\">nucleobase</a> (frequently just called a base).<a href=\"https://www.microbe.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/dna_deoxyribonucleic_acid_adv.jpg\"><br/>\n</a></p>\n<p>The bases come in four chemical forms known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine\">adenine</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine\">cytosine</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine\">guanine</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine\">thymine</a>, which are frequently simply abbreviated as A, C, G and T. The order, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_sequence\">“sequence”</a>, of bases encodes the information in DNA.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.microbe.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Slide3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>DNA double helix</figcaption></figure>\n<p>All living organisms store DNA in a safe, stable, duplex form: the famous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_helix\">“double helix”</a>, in which two chains (also known as strands) of DNA wrap around each other. The two DNA strands are arranged with the bases from one lining up with the bases of the other. The sugar and phosphate components run up the outside like curving rails, with the matched bases forming ladder-like rails in the center. (Note – some viruses have their genetic material in the form of a single strand of DNA).</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.microbe.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/base_pair_adv.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Nucleotide Base Pairing</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The shape and charge of the bases cause A to bond weakly to T, and C to bond weakly to G. The bases from one strand of a DNA helix are in essence a mirror image of the bases in the other strand – when there is an A in one strand there is a T in the other; when there is a C in one strand there is a G in the other. These <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#Base_pairing\">“base pairing”</a> rules are the key to understanding how DNA carries information and is copied into a new DNA strand (a cell must copy its DNA before it divides into two cells). When organisms copy their genomes, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme\">enzymes</a> separate the two strands of the double helix, pulling apart the paired bases. Other enzymes start new DNA strands, using the base pairing rules to make a new mirror image of each of the original strands. Mistakes in this process can lead to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutations\"><strong>mutations</strong></a> (changes in the genomic sequence between generations). Many organisms possess error checking mechanisms that scan through the newly replicated DNA for mistakes and correct them, thus greatly limiting the number of mutations that arise due to replication errors.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>2. RNA ”carries” information</strong><br/>\nDNA holds information, but it generally does not actively apply that information. DNA does not <em>make </em>things. To extract the information and get it to the location of cellular machinery that can carry out its instructions (usually the blueprints for a protein, as we will see below) the DNA code is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_%28genetics%29\">“transcribed”</a> into a corresponding sequence in a “carrier” molecule called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA\">ribonucleic acid, or RNA</a>. The portions of DNA that are transcribed into RNA are called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genes\">“genes”</a>.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.microbe.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/transcription.jpg\"></a><figcaption>DNA is transcribed to RNA</figcaption></figure>\n<p>RNA is very similar to DNA. It resembles a long chain, with the links in the chain made up of individual nucleotides. The nucleotides in RNA, as in DNA, are made up of three components – a sugar, phosphate, and a base. The sugar in RNA is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribose\">ribose</a> instead of the more stable dexoyribose in DNA, which helps to make RNA both more flexible and less durable.</p>\n<p>As in DNA, in RNA the bases come in four chemical forms, and the information in RNA is encoded in the sequence in which these bases are arranged. As in DNA, in RNA one finds adenine (A), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). However, in RNA <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil\">uracil (abbreviated U)</a> takes the place of thymine (T) (the switch allows RNA some special properties that we won’t go into here, at the cost of making it less stable than DNA). Cells make RNA messages in a process similar to the replication of DNA. The DNA strands are pulled apart in the location of the gene to be transcribed, and enzymes create the messenger RNA from the sequence of DNA bases using the base pairing rules.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>3. RNA molecules made in a cell are used in a variety of ways.</strong></p>\n<p>For our purposes here, there are three key types of RNA: messenger RNA, ribosomal RNA, and transfer RNA. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA\"><strong>Messenger RNA (mRNA)</strong></a> carries the instructions for making proteins. Like DNA, proteins are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer\">polymers</a>: long chains assembled from prefab molecular units, which, in the case of proteins, are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acids\">amino acids</a>.

Organisms store information as DNA, release or carry information as RNA, and transform information into the proteins that perform most of the functions of cells (for example, some proteins also access and operate the DNA library). This <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology\">“central dogma”</a> of molecular biology is an extremely simplistic model, but useful for following the flow of information in biological systems. Among the core features:</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>1. DNA is the genetic material of all cellular organisms.</strong></p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.microbe.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/cytosine.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Cytosine, a nucleotide</figcaption></figure>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA\">Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)</a> is the material substance of inheritance. All cellular organisms use DNA to encode and store their genetic information. DNA is a chemical compound that resembles a long chain, with the links in the chain made up of individual chemical units called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide\">nucleotides</a>. The nucleotides themselves have three components: a sugar (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose\">deoxyribose</a>), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate\">phosphate</a>, and a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleobase\">nucleobase</a> (frequently just called a base).<a href=\"https://www.microbe.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/dna_deoxyribonucleic_acid_adv.jpg\"><br/>\n</a></p>\n<p>The bases come in four chemical forms known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine\">adenine</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine\">cytosine</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine\">guanine</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine\">thymine</a>, which are frequently simply abbreviated as A, C, G and T. The order, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_sequence\">“sequence”</a>, of bases encodes the information in DNA.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.microbe.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Slide3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>DNA double helix</figcaption></figure>\n<p>All living organisms store DNA in a safe, stable, duplex form: the famous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_helix\">“double helix”</a>, in which two chains (also known as strands) of DNA wrap around each other. The two DNA strands are arranged with the bases from one lining up with the bases of the other. The sugar and phosphate components run up the outside like curving rails, with the matched bases forming ladder-like rails in the center. (Note – some viruses have their genetic material in the form of a single strand of DNA).</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.microbe.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/base_pair_adv.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Nucleotide Base Pairing</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The shape and charge of the bases cause A to bond weakly to T, and C to bond weakly to G. The bases from one strand of a DNA helix are in essence a mirror image of the bases in the other strand – when there is an A in one strand there is a T in the other; when there is a C in one strand there is a G in the other. These <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#Base_pairing\">“base pairing”</a> rules are the key to understanding how DNA carries information and is copied into a new DNA strand (a cell must copy its DNA before it divides into two cells). When organisms copy their genomes, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme\">enzymes</a> separate the two strands of the double helix, pulling apart the paired bases. Other enzymes start new DNA strands, using the base pairing rules to make a new mirror image of each of the original strands. Mistakes in this process can lead to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutations\"><strong>mutations</strong></a> (changes in the genomic sequence between generations). Many organisms possess error checking mechanisms that scan through the newly replicated DNA for mistakes and correct them, thus greatly limiting the number of mutations that arise due to replication errors.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>2. RNA ”carries” information</strong><br/>\nDNA holds information, but it generally does not actively apply that information. DNA does not <em>make </em>things. To extract the information and get it to the location of cellular machinery that can carry out its instructions (usually the blueprints for a protein, as we will see below) the DNA code is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_%28genetics%29\">“transcribed”</a> into a corresponding sequence in a “carrier” molecule called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA\">ribonucleic acid, or RNA</a>. The portions of DNA that are transcribed into RNA are called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genes\">“genes”</a>.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.microbe.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/transcription.jpg\"></a><figcaption>DNA is transcribed to RNA</figcaption></figure>\n<p>RNA is very similar to DNA. It resembles a long chain, with the links in the chain made up of individual nucleotides. The nucleotides in RNA, as in DNA, are made up of three components – a sugar, phosphate, and a base. The sugar in RNA is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribose\">ribose</a> instead of the more stable dexoyribose in DNA, which helps to make RNA both more flexible and less durable.</p>\n<p>As in DNA, in RNA the bases come in four chemical forms, and the information in RNA is encoded in the sequence in which these bases are arranged. As in DNA, in RNA one finds adenine (A), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). However, in RNA <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil\">uracil (abbreviated U)</a> takes the place of thymine (T) (the switch allows RNA some special properties that we won’t go into here, at the cost of making it less stable than DNA). Cells make RNA messages in a process similar to the replication of DNA. The DNA strands are pulled apart in the location of the gene to be transcribed, and enzymes create the messenger RNA from the sequence of DNA bases using the base pairing rules.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>3. RNA molecules made in a cell are used in a variety of ways.</strong></p>\n<p>For our purposes here, there are three key types of RNA: messenger RNA, ribosomal RNA, and transfer RNA. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA\"><strong>Messenger RNA (mRNA)</strong></a> carries the instructions for making proteins. Like DNA, proteins are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer\">polymers</a>: long chains assembled from prefab molecular units, which, in the case of proteins, are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acids\">amino acids</a>. A large molecular machine* called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome\">ribosome</a> translates the mRNA code and assembles the proteins. Ribosomes read the message in mRNA in three letter “words” called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codon\">codons</a>, which translate to specific amino acids, or an instruction to stop making the protein. Each possible three letter arrangement of A,C,U,G (e.g., AAA, AAU, GGC, etc) is a specific instruction, and the correspondence of these instructions and the amino acids is known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code\">“genetic code.”</a> Though exceptions to or variations on the code exist, the standard genetic code holds true in most organisms.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.microbe.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/codon.jpg\"></a><figcaption>mRNA codons</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Ribosomes are found in all cellular organisms and they are incredibly similar in their structure and function across all of life. In fact, the extreme similarity of ribosomes across all of life is one of the lines of evidence that all life on the planet is descended from a common ancestor.</p>\n<p>*<em>Biologists often refer to proteins, especially large complexes of proteins, that move, turn, lever, or generally use energy to perform work, as “machines”.

The information in RNA, although copied into another chemical form, is still written in essentially the same language as it is in DNA—the language of a nucleotide sequence. Hence the name <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/#A5880\">transcription</a>.</p><p>Like <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5084/\">DNA</a>, <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/\">RNA</a> is a linear <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5655/\">polymer</a> made of four different types of <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5567/\">nucleotide</a> subunits linked together by phosphodiester bonds (<a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A978/?report=objectonly\">Figure 6-4</a>). It differs from DNA chemically in two respects: (1) the nucleotides in RNA are <i>ribonucleotides</i>—that is, they contain the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5842/\">sugar</a> ribose (hence the name <i>ribo</i><a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5561/\">nucleic acid</a>) rather than deoxyribose; (2) although, like DNA, RNA contains the bases adenine (A), guanine (<a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5198/\">G</a>), and cytosine (C), it contains the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4875/\">base</a> uracil (U) instead of the thymine (T) in DNA. Since U, like T, can base-pair by hydrogen-bonding with A (<a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A979/?report=objectonly\">Figure 6-5</a>), the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5012/\">complementary</a> base-pairing properties described for DNA in Chapters 4 and 5 apply also to RNA (in RNA, G pairs with C, and A pairs with U). It is not uncommon, however, to find other types of base pairs in RNA: for example, G pairing with U occasionally.\n</p><div><p><a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A978/?report=objectonly\"></a></p><div><h4><a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A978/?report=objectonly\">Figure 6-4</a></h4><p>The chemical structure of RNA.

The absence of a methyl group in U has no effect on base-pairing; thus, U-A base pairs closely resemble T-A base pairs (see Figure 4-4). </p></div></div><p>Despite these small chemical differences, <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5084/\">DNA</a> and <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/\">RNA</a> differ quite dramatically in overall structure. Whereas DNA always occurs in cells as a double-stranded helix, RNA is single-stranded. RNA chains therefore fold up into a variety of shapes, just as a <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5658/\">polypeptide</a> chain folds up to form the final shape of a <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5688/\">protein</a> (<a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A980/?report=objectonly\">Figure 6-6</a>). As we see later in this chapter, the ability to fold into <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5014/\">complex</a> three-dimensional shapes allows some RNA molecules to have structural and catalytic functions.\n</p><div><p><a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A980/?report=objectonly\"></a></p><div><h4><a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A980/?report=objectonly\">Figure 6-6</a></h4><p>RNA can fold into specific structures. RNA is largely single-stranded, but it often contains short stretches of nucleotides that can form conventional base-pairs with complementary sequences found elsewhere on the same molecule. These interactions, along <a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A980/?report=objectonly\">(more...)</a></p></div></div></div><div><h2>Transcription Produces RNA Complementary to One Strand of DNA</h2><p>All of the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/\">RNA</a> in a cell is made by <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5098/\">DNA transcription</a>, a process that has certain similarities to the process of DNA replication discussed in Chapter 5. Transcription begins with the opening and unwinding of a small portion of the DNA <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5106/\">double helix</a> to expose the bases on each DNA strand. One of the two strands of the DNA double helix then acts as a <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5862/\">template</a> for the synthesis of an RNA <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5486/\">molecule</a>. As in DNA replication, the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5567/\">nucleotide</a> sequence of the RNA chain is <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5070/\">determined</a> by the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5012/\">complementary</a> <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4875/\">base</a>-pairing between incoming nucleotides and the DNA template. When a good match is made, the incoming ribonucleotide is covalently linked to the growing RNA chain in an enzymatically catalyzed <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5717/\">reaction</a>. The RNA chain produced by transcription—the <i><a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5879/\">transcript</a></i>—is therefore elongated one nucleotide at a time, and it has a nucleotide sequence that is exactly complementary to the strand of DNA used as the template (<a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A982/?report=objectonly\">Figure 6-7</a>).\n</p><div><p><a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A982/?report=objectonly\"></a></p><div><h4><a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A982/?report=objectonly\">Figure 6-7</a></h4><p>DNA transcription produces a single-stranded RNA molecule that is complementary to one strand of DNA. </p></div></div><p>Transcription, however, differs from <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5084/\">DNA</a> replication in several crucial ways. Unlike a newly formed DNA strand, the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/\">RNA</a> strand does not remain hydrogen-bonded to the DNA <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5862/\">template</a> strand. Instead, just behind the region where the ribonucleotides are being added, the RNA chain is displaced and the DNA helix re-forms. Thus, the RNA molecules produced by transcription are released from the DNA template as single strands. In addition, because they are copied from only a limited region of the DNA, RNA molecules are much shorter than DNA molecules. A DNA <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5486/\">molecule</a> in a human <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4977/\">chromosome</a> can be up to 250 million <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5567/\">nucleotide</a>-pairs long; in contrast, most RNAs are no more than a few thousand nucleotides long, and many are considerably shorter.</p><p>The enzymes that perform transcription are called <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/#A5760\">RNA polymerases</a>. Like the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5092/\">DNA polymerase</a> that catalyzes DNA replication (discussed in Chapter 5), <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/\">RNA</a> polymerases catalyze the formation of the phosphodiester bonds that link the nucleotides together to form a linear chain. The <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5760/\">RNA polymerase</a> moves stepwise along the DNA, unwinding the DNA helix just ahead of the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4772/\">active site</a> for polymerization to expose a new region of the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5862/\">template</a> strand for <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5012/\">complementary</a> <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4875/\">base</a>-pairing. In this way, the growing RNA chain is extended by one <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5567/\">nucleotide</a> at a time in the 5′-to-3′ direction (<a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A983/?report=objectonly\">Figure 6-8</a>).

This allows the amount of protein A in the cell to be much greater than that of protein B. </p></div></div><div><h2>Portions of DNA Sequence Are Transcribed into RNA</h2><p>The first step a cell takes in reading out a needed part of its genetic instructions is to copy a particular portion of its <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5084/\">DNA</a> <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5567/\">nucleotide</a> sequence—a <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5215/\">gene</a>—into an <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/\">RNA</a> nucleotide sequence. The information in RNA, although copied into another chemical form, is still written in essentially the same language as it is in DNA—the language of a nucleotide sequence. Hence the name <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/#A5880\">transcription</a>.</p><p>Like <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5084/\">DNA</a>, <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/\">RNA</a> is a linear <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5655/\">polymer</a> made of four different types of <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5567/\">nucleotide</a> subunits linked together by phosphodiester bonds (<a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A978/?report=objectonly\">Figure 6-4</a>). It differs from DNA chemically in two respects: (1) the nucleotides in RNA are <i>ribonucleotides</i>—that is, they contain the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5842/\">sugar</a> ribose (hence the name <i>ribo</i><a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5561/\">nucleic acid</a>) rather than deoxyribose; (2) although, like DNA, RNA contains the bases adenine (A), guanine (<a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5198/\">G</a>), and cytosine (C), it contains the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4875/\">base</a> uracil (U) instead of the thymine (T) in DNA. Since U, like T, can base-pair by hydrogen-bonding with A (<a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A979/?report=objectonly\">Figure 6-5</a>), the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5012/\">complementary</a> base-pairing properties described for DNA in Chapters 4 and 5 apply also to RNA (in RNA, G pairs with C, and A pairs with U). It is not uncommon, however, to find other types of base pairs in RNA: for example, G pairing with U occasionally.\n</p><div><p><a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A978/?report=objectonly\"></a></p><div><h4><a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A978/?report=objectonly\">Figure 6-4</a></h4><p>The chemical structure of RNA.

Whereas DNA always occurs in cells as a double-stranded helix, RNA is single-stranded. RNA chains therefore fold up into a variety of shapes, just as a <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5658/\">polypeptide</a> chain folds up to form the final shape of a <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5688/\">protein</a> (<a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A980/?report=objectonly\">Figure 6-6</a>). As we see later in this chapter, the ability to fold into <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5014/\">complex</a> three-dimensional shapes allows some RNA molecules to have structural and catalytic functions.\n</p><div><p><a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A980/?report=objectonly\"></a></p><div><h4><a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A980/?report=objectonly\">Figure 6-6</a></h4><p>RNA can fold into specific structures.

These interactions, along <a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A980/?report=objectonly\">(more...)</a></p></div></div></div><div><h2>Transcription Produces RNA Complementary to One Strand of DNA</h2><p>All of the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/\">RNA</a> in a cell is made by <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5098/\">DNA transcription</a>, a process that has certain similarities to the process of DNA replication discussed in Chapter 5. Transcription begins with the opening and unwinding of a small portion of the DNA <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5106/\">double helix</a> to expose the bases on each DNA strand. One of the two strands of the DNA double helix then acts as a <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5862/\">template</a> for the synthesis of an RNA <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5486/\">molecule</a>. As in DNA replication, the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5567/\">nucleotide</a> sequence of the RNA chain is <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5070/\">determined</a> by the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5012/\">complementary</a> <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4875/\">base</a>-pairing between incoming nucleotides and the DNA template. When a good match is made, the incoming ribonucleotide is covalently linked to the growing RNA chain in an enzymatically catalyzed <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5717/\">reaction</a>. The RNA chain produced by transcription—the <i><a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5879/\">transcript</a></i>—is therefore elongated one nucleotide at a time, and it has a nucleotide sequence that is exactly complementary to the strand of DNA used as the template (<a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A982/?report=objectonly\">Figure 6-7</a>).\n</p><div><p><a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A982/?report=objectonly\"></a></p><div><h4><a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A982/?report=objectonly\">Figure 6-7</a></h4><p>DNA transcription produces a single-stranded RNA molecule that is complementary to one strand of DNA. </p></div></div><p>Transcription, however, differs from <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5084/\">DNA</a> replication in several crucial ways. Unlike a newly formed DNA strand, the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/\">RNA</a> strand does not remain hydrogen-bonded to the DNA <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5862/\">template</a> strand. Instead, just behind the region where the ribonucleotides are being added, the RNA chain is displaced and the DNA helix re-forms. Thus, the RNA molecules produced by transcription are released from the DNA template as single strands. In addition, because they are copied from only a limited region of the DNA, RNA molecules are much shorter than DNA molecules. A DNA <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5486/\">molecule</a> in a human <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4977/\">chromosome</a> can be up to 250 million <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5567/\">nucleotide</a>-pairs long; in contrast, most RNAs are no more than a few thousand nucleotides long, and many are considerably shorter.</p><p>The enzymes that perform transcription are called <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/#A5760\">RNA polymerases</a>. Like the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5092/\">DNA polymerase</a> that catalyzes DNA replication (discussed in Chapter 5), <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/\">RNA</a> polymerases catalyze the formation of the phosphodiester bonds that link the nucleotides together to form a linear chain. The <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5760/\">RNA polymerase</a> moves stepwise along the DNA, unwinding the DNA helix just ahead of the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4772/\">active site</a> for polymerization to expose a new region of the <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5862/\">template</a> strand for <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5012/\">complementary</a> <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4875/\">base</a>-pairing. In this way, the growing RNA chain is extended by one <a href=\"/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5567/\">nucleotide</a> at a time in the 5′-to-3′ direction (<a href=\"/books/NBK26887/figure/A983/?report=objectonly\">Figure 6-8</a>).

The chemical makeup of ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), generally represented by a sequence of four monomers, also provides precise instructions for folding and higher-order assembly of these biopolymers that, in turn, dictate biological functions. The sequence-based specific 3D structures of nucleic acids led to the development of the directed evolution of oligonucleotides, SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment), against a chosen target molecule. Among the variety of functions, selected oligonucleotides named aptamers also allow targeting of cell-specific receptors with antibody-like precision and can deliver functional RNAs without a transfection agent. The advancements in the field of customizable nucleic acid nanoparticles (NANPs) opened avenues for the design of nanoassemblies utilizing aptamers for triggering or blocking cell signaling pathways or using aptamer–receptor combinations to activate therapeutic functionalities. A recent selection of fluorescent aptamers enables real-time tracking of NANP formation and interactions. The aptamers are anticipated to contribute to the future development of technologies, enabling an efficient assembly of functional NANPs in mammalian cells or <em>in vivo</em>. These research topics are of top importance for the field of therapeutic nucleic acid nanotechnology with the promises to scale up mass production of NANPs suitable for biomedical applications, to control the intracellular organization of biological materials to enhance the efficiency of biochemical pathways, and to enhance the therapeutic potential of NANP-based therapeutics while minimizing undesired side effects and toxicities.</p>\n<section><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> SELEX, aptamers, NANPs, therapeutic nucleic acids, immunotherapy, exosomes, RNA nanotechnology, nucleic acid delivery</p></section></section><section><h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>\n<p></p></section><hr/>\n<p>In the last three decades, the continuous discovery of different classes of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) involved in many crucial cellular pathways and regulations tremendously boosted and expanded the field of RNA biology.<sup><a href=\"#R1\">1</a></sup> In contrast to coding parts of mRNA, ncRNAs’ folding and overall resulting 3D structures determine their functions. Our increasing understanding of the roles that ncRNAs play in biology not only engenders intriguing questions about the extent of ncRNA importance for cellular life but also encourages the exploration of various therapeutic strategies where RNAs can be targets for therapies and also serve as therapeutics themselves.<sup><a href=\"#R2\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>Through the simple interactions between two nucleic acid strands (RNA–RNA, DNA–RNA, DNA–DNA) that are dictated by the canonical Watson–Crick base-pairing rules, it is plausible to target aberrant RNA transcripts (<em>e.g</em>., mRNA) with high specificity. Subsequently, the targeted strand, in the form of duplex RNA–RNA or hybrid DNA–RNA, becomes diverted or completely removed from the original biological pathway. This approach, based on the complementarity between therapeutic and disease-specific nucleic acids, is promising for the treatment of a variety of diseases.<sup><a href=\"#R3\">3</a></sup> Additionally, the interactions between therapeutic nucleic acids (TNAs) and disease-relevant proteins or metabolites are also of importance, whereas combining further two or more different TNAs in a single formulation represents a promising combinatorial strategy for synergistic therapeutics.<sup><a href=\"#R4\">4</a>–<a href=\"#R6\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p>Aptamers are becoming a key component of TNA technology, facilitating cell-specific delivery or high-affinity recognition of target molecules. Aptamers are single-stranded oligonucleotides that can be considered nucleic acid analogues of monoclonal antibodies. The coupling of aptamers with multiple TNAs <em>via</em> assembly of programmable nucleic acid nanoparticles (NANPs) provides a modular platform to simultaneously target different biological pathways for enhanced therapeutic effects. In this review, we will discuss the selection of aptamers, their mechanisms of actions, therapeutic potential, and use as experimental tools to promote the field of therapeutic nucleic acid nanotechnology (<a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1</a>).</p>\n<figure><h2>Figure 1.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<figcaption><p>Schematic description of growing structural and functional complexity of aptamer involvements into nucleic acid nanotechnology. Fluorescently labeled aptamers that are specific to cell receptors can be used for cell detection. Their interactions with receptors often result in modulation of the receptor signaling. Later development led to the design of aptamer chimeras, where aptamers deliver the functional RNA or DNA moieties to target cells. Inclusion of aptamers to NANPs enhances the combinatorial applications of aptamers in changing cellular pathways and allowing for NANPs to logically respond to the presence of key triggers. In addition, light-up aptamers are potentially suitable reporters of NANP assembly or real-time monitoring of mutual interactions of NANPs <em>in vivo</em>. One of the future applications of aptamers in NANP technology could be a transport of NANPs to cell vesicles or viral vectors that would be mediated by aptamers targeted to vesicle- or virus-specific proteins.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Generation of Aptamers <em>via</em> SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment). All single-stranded RNAs adopt more or less complex tertiary structures which interact with other cellular components and most importantly with proteins. Those interactions are either essential for RNA maturation or RNA itself assumes a crucial part of active RNA–protein complexes. Nucleic acids interact with proteins in varying degrees through physical forces, among which are electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding.

The sequence-based specific 3D structures of nucleic acids led to the development of the directed evolution of oligonucleotides, SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment), against a chosen target molecule. Among the variety of functions, selected oligonucleotides named aptamers also allow targeting of cell-specific receptors with antibody-like precision and can deliver functional RNAs without a transfection agent. The advancements in the field of customizable nucleic acid nanoparticles (NANPs) opened avenues for the design of nanoassemblies utilizing aptamers for triggering or blocking cell signaling pathways or using aptamer–receptor combinations to activate therapeutic functionalities. A recent selection of fluorescent aptamers enables real-time tracking of NANP formation and interactions. The aptamers are anticipated to contribute to the future development of technologies, enabling an efficient assembly of functional NANPs in mammalian cells or <em>in vivo</em>. These research topics are of top importance for the field of therapeutic nucleic acid nanotechnology with the promises to scale up mass production of NANPs suitable for biomedical applications, to control the intracellular organization of biological materials to enhance the efficiency of biochemical pathways, and to enhance the therapeutic potential of NANP-based therapeutics while minimizing undesired side effects and toxicities.</p>\n<section><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> SELEX, aptamers, NANPs, therapeutic nucleic acids, immunotherapy, exosomes, RNA nanotechnology, nucleic acid delivery</p></section></section><section><h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>\n<p></p></section><hr/>\n<p>In the last three decades, the continuous discovery of different classes of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) involved in many crucial cellular pathways and regulations tremendously boosted and expanded the field of RNA biology.<sup><a href=\"#R1\">1</a></sup> In contrast to coding parts of mRNA, ncRNAs’ folding and overall resulting 3D structures determine their functions. Our increasing understanding of the roles that ncRNAs play in biology not only engenders intriguing questions about the extent of ncRNA importance for cellular life but also encourages the exploration of various therapeutic strategies where RNAs can be targets for therapies and also serve as therapeutics themselves.<sup><a href=\"#R2\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>Through the simple interactions between two nucleic acid strands (RNA–RNA, DNA–RNA, DNA–DNA) that are dictated by the canonical Watson–Crick base-pairing rules, it is plausible to target aberrant RNA transcripts (<em>e.g</em>., mRNA) with high specificity. Subsequently, the targeted strand, in the form of duplex RNA–RNA or hybrid DNA–RNA, becomes diverted or completely removed from the original biological pathway. This approach, based on the complementarity between therapeutic and disease-specific nucleic acids, is promising for the treatment of a variety of diseases.<sup><a href=\"#R3\">3</a></sup> Additionally, the interactions between therapeutic nucleic acids (TNAs) and disease-relevant proteins or metabolites are also of importance, whereas combining further two or more different TNAs in a single formulation represents a promising combinatorial strategy for synergistic therapeutics.<sup><a href=\"#R4\">4</a>–<a href=\"#R6\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p>Aptamers are becoming a key component of TNA technology, facilitating cell-specific delivery or high-affinity recognition of target molecules. Aptamers are single-stranded oligonucleotides that can be considered nucleic acid analogues of monoclonal antibodies. The coupling of aptamers with multiple TNAs <em>via</em> assembly of programmable nucleic acid nanoparticles (NANPs) provides a modular platform to simultaneously target different biological pathways for enhanced therapeutic effects. In this review, we will discuss the selection of aptamers, their mechanisms of actions, therapeutic potential, and use as experimental tools to promote the field of therapeutic nucleic acid nanotechnology (<a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1</a>).</p>\n<figure><h2>Figure 1.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<figcaption><p>Schematic description of growing structural and functional complexity of aptamer involvements into nucleic acid nanotechnology. Fluorescently labeled aptamers that are specific to cell receptors can be used for cell detection. Their interactions with receptors often result in modulation of the receptor signaling. Later development led to the design of aptamer chimeras, where aptamers deliver the functional RNA or DNA moieties to target cells. Inclusion of aptamers to NANPs enhances the combinatorial applications of aptamers in changing cellular pathways and allowing for NANPs to logically respond to the presence of key triggers. In addition, light-up aptamers are potentially suitable reporters of NANP assembly or real-time monitoring of mutual interactions of NANPs <em>in vivo</em>. One of the future applications of aptamers in NANP technology could be a transport of NANPs to cell vesicles or viral vectors that would be mediated by aptamers targeted to vesicle- or virus-specific proteins.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Generation of Aptamers <em>via</em> SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment).

Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms contain a certain proportion of repeats in the genome<sup><a href=\"#CR2\">2</a>–<a href=\"#CR4\">4</a></sup>, particularly mammalians, in which repeats account for 25–50% of their entire genome (Supplementary Fig. <a href=\"#MOESM1\">S1)</a>. For instance, about 50% of the human genome consists of repeats<sup><a href=\"#CR5\">5</a></sup>, while roughly 4% of human genes harbor transposable elements in their protein-coding regions<sup><a href=\"#CR6\">6</a></sup>. Because many of these repeats (~89.5%) are located within introns, they have been erroneously assumed to be non-functional<sup><a href=\"#CR7\">7</a></sup>. However, increasing research indicates the significant impacts that repeats in coding and noncoding regions can have on evolution, gene expression regulation, and variation induction<sup><a href=\"#CR8\">8</a>–<a href=\"#CR10\">10</a></sup>. For example, when repeats are present in the coding region they get translated canonically. Not only can non-coding repeats be translated by a non-canonical mechanism<sup><a href=\"#CR11\">11</a></sup>, but even the telomeric repeat RNAs can get translated<sup><a href=\"#CR12\">12</a></sup>. Moreover, recent studies have shown that such repeats are closely related to a variety of diseases, such as genetic disorders (e.g., Hemophilia), neurological diseases (e.g., poly-Q diseases), and cancers (e.g., endometrial, stomach and colorectal cancers)<sup><a href=\"#CR13\">13</a>–<a href=\"#CR15\">15</a></sup>. A glossary table (Supplementary Table <a href=\"#MOESM1\">S1)</a> used to explain acronyms/terminologies in this study is shown in Supplementary Note <a href=\"#MOESM1\">1</a>.</p>\n<p>DNA sequences can be categorized into three groups according to their recurrence frequency<sup><a href=\"#CR16\">16</a></sup>, as shown in Fig. <a href=\"#Fig1\">1</a>(a). The first group is composed of high-frequency repeats, also known as satellite DNA sequences (<strong>satDNAs</strong>), which are found in various regions of the chromosomes, including pericentromeric, subtelomeric, and interstitial regions. These sequences typically form constitutive blocks of heterochromatin that are essential components of structures such as centromeres and telomeres<sup><a href=\"#CR17\">17</a></sup>. The length of satDNA repeating units can vary from a few base pairs to over 1 kilobase pairs, forming arrays that can span up to 100 megabases and be repeated over 10<sup>6</sup> times, making up ~8–10% of the human genome<sup><a href=\"#CR18\">18</a></sup>.</p>\n<figure><h3>Fig. 1.

The color arrows represent the repetitive unit (or motif) of each kind of TR, and the light black structure represents the chromosome.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The second group comprises moderate-frequency repeats that are typically 500–300,000 base pairs in length and repeated between 10 and 10<sup>5</sup> times, accounting for ~30% of all repeats<sup><a href=\"#CR19\">19</a></sup>. These repeats are further classified into two subcategories: (A) microsatellites and minisatellites (VNTR), and (B) dispersed repeats, which are primarily made up of transposable elements (<strong>TEs</strong>)<sup><a href=\"#CR20\">20</a></sup>. It is worth noting that many moderate-frequency repeats have been implicated in gene expression regulation<sup><a href=\"#CR21\">21</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>The third group comprises unique, single-copy DNA sequences, which do not share homology with any other sequences in the genome. Examples of such sequences in the human genome include protein-coding genes (e.g., the <em>globin</em>, <em>ovalbumin</em>, and <em>silk fibroin</em> genes), non-coding RNAs, and regulatory elements that control gene expression<sup><a href=\"#CR22\">22</a>,<a href=\"#CR23\">23</a></sup>. Approximately 40–50% of the total human DNA sequences are single-copy DNA sequences, meaning that about half of the human genome is composed of unique and non-repetitive sequences.</p>\n<p>According to the arrangement of repeating units, repeats can be classified into two types: tandem repeats (TRs) and interspersed repeats<sup><a href=\"#CR24\">24</a></sup>, as depicted in Fig. <a href=\"#Fig1\">1</a>(b). Interspersed repeats, also known as <strong>transposons</strong> or <strong>TEs</strong>, consist of DNA and RNA transposons<sup><a href=\"#CR25\">25</a></sup>. Generally, TRs refer to a sequence array formed by the repeated occurrence of basic repeating units connected head-to-tail<sup><a href=\"#CR26\">26</a></sup> (Supplementary Note <a href=\"#MOESM1\">2)</a>. TRs, especially satellite DNA, are clustered in specific chromosomal regions such as centromeres, tetramers, and telomeres, which play an essential role in cellular processes, including chromosome segregation, genome organization, and chromosome end protection<sup><a href=\"#CR27\">27</a></sup>. For example, centromeres contain long tandem arrays of <em>a</em><em>l</em><em>p</em><em>h</em><em>a</em>-satellite repeats that extend over millions of base pairs and are organized in a hierarchical manner. The tandem arrays span between 100 and 5000 bp on different chromosomes, ranging from 0.2 to 10 Mb. Some of these arrays include 17 bp binding motifs for the centromere-specific DNA binding protein, which have been used to create synthetic human chromosomes<sup><a href=\"#CR28\">28</a></sup>.</p>\n<section><h3>Tandem repeats</h3>\n<p>Tandem Repeats in the human genome can be divided into the following subcategories: microsatellites, minisatellites, centromeric satellites, and telomeric and subtelomeric repeats (Fig. <a href=\"#Fig1\">1</a>(f) and Table <a href=\"#Tab1\">1</a>). The difference between microsatellites and minisatellites is represented in their length and frequency of occurrence. Microsatellites are DNA sequences of &lt;5 bp units repeated in tandem and are most frequent in the human genome<sup><a href=\"#CR29\">29</a></sup>. Minisatellites are tandem repetitions of more than 5 bp units, and their frequency in the human genome is relatively rarer than that of the former<sup><a href=\"#CR30\">30</a></sup>. In the human genome, centromeric satellites can be classified into the <em>a</em><em>l</em><em>p</em><em>h</em><em>a</em>-satellite and Satellite II/III. Among them, Satellite II/III comprises of various variations on the <em>ATTCC</em> motif<sup><a href=\"#CR31\">31</a></sup>. Telomeric repeats (satellites) are located at the telomeres, consisting of 300–8000 precise <em>CCCTAA/TTAGGG</em> motifs and covering a range of 2–50 kb on the end of the chromosomes<sup><a href=\"#CR32\">32</a></sup>. Subtelomeric repeats are located in the boundary of 100–300 kb between the telomere and the remaining part of the chromosome, consisting of satellite-like sequences<sup><a href=\"#CR33\">33</a></sup>. Type, length, frequency, and distribution of TRs in the human genome are summarized in Table <a href=\"#Tab1\">1</a> and Supplementary Table <a href=\"#MOESM1\">S2</a>.</p>\n<section><h4>Table 1.</h4>\n<p>Classes and length distribution of tandem repeats in the human genome.</p>\n<div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Class of TRs</th>\n<th>Length of TR unit</th>\n<th>Length of TR array</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Telomeres</th>\n<th>~6 bp</th>\n<th>~10–15 kb</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>",

TRs, especially satellite DNA, are clustered in specific chromosomal regions such as centromeres, tetramers, and telomeres, which play an essential role in cellular processes, including chromosome segregation, genome organization, and chromosome end protection<sup><a href=\"#CR27\">27</a></sup>. For example, centromeres contain long tandem arrays of <em>a</em><em>l</em><em>p</em><em>h</em><em>a</em>-satellite repeats that extend over millions of base pairs and are organized in a hierarchical manner. The tandem arrays span between 100 and 5000 bp on different chromosomes, ranging from 0.2 to 10 Mb. Some of these arrays include 17 bp binding motifs for the centromere-specific DNA binding protein, which have been used to create synthetic human chromosomes<sup><a href=\"#CR28\">28</a></sup>.</p>\n<section><h3>Tandem repeats</h3>\n<p>Tandem Repeats in the human genome can be divided into the following subcategories: microsatellites, minisatellites, centromeric satellites, and telomeric and subtelomeric repeats (Fig. <a href=\"#Fig1\">1</a>(f) and Table <a href=\"#Tab1\">1</a>). The difference between microsatellites and minisatellites is represented in their length and frequency of occurrence. Microsatellites are DNA sequences of &lt;5 bp units repeated in tandem and are most frequent in the human genome<sup><a href=\"#CR29\">29</a></sup>. Minisatellites are tandem repetitions of more than 5 bp units, and their frequency in the human genome is relatively rarer than that of the former<sup><a href=\"#CR30\">30</a></sup>. In the human genome, centromeric satellites can be classified into the <em>a</em><em>l</em><em>p</em><em>h</em><em>a</em>-satellite and Satellite II/III. Among them, Satellite II/III comprises of various variations on the <em>ATTCC</em> motif<sup><a href=\"#CR31\">31</a></sup>. Telomeric repeats (satellites) are located at the telomeres, consisting of 300–8000 precise <em>CCCTAA/TTAGGG</em> motifs and covering a range of 2–50 kb on the end of the chromosomes<sup><a href=\"#CR32\">32</a></sup>. Subtelomeric repeats are located in the boundary of 100–300 kb between the telomere and the remaining part of the chromosome, consisting of satellite-like sequences<sup><a href=\"#CR33\">33</a></sup>. Type, length, frequency, and distribution of TRs in the human genome are summarized in Table <a href=\"#Tab1\">1</a> and Supplementary Table <a href=\"#MOESM1\">S2</a>.</p>\n<section><h4>Table 1.</h4>\n<p>Classes and length distribution of tandem repeats in the human genome.</p>\n<div><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Class of TRs</th>\n<th>Length of TR unit</th>\n<th>Length of TR array</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Telomeres</th>\n<th>~6 bp</th>\n<th>~10–15 kb</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>",

But what's actually most interesting about this process is how it's carried out in a cell.</p></div><div><p>Cells need to copy their DNA very quickly, and with very few errors (or risk problems such as cancer). To do so, they use a variety of enzymes and proteins, which work together to make sure DNA replication is performed smoothly and accurately.</p></div></div><div><p></p><h2>DNA polymerase</h2><p></p><div><p>One of the key molecules in DNA replication is the enzyme <strong>DNA polymerase</strong>. DNA polymerases are responsible for synthesizing DNA: they add nucleotides one by one to the growing DNA chain, incorporating only those that are complementary to the template.</p></div><div><p>Here are some key features of DNA polymerases:</p></div><div><ul><li><p>They always need a template</p></li><li><p>They can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of a DNA strand</p></li><li><p>They can't start making a DNA chain from scratch, but require a pre-existing chain or short stretch of nucleotides called a <strong>primer</strong></p></li><li><p>They <strong>proofread</strong>, or check their work, removing the vast majority of \"wrong\" nucleotides that are accidentally added to the chain</p></li></ul></div><div><p>The addition of nucleotides requires energy. This energy comes from the nucleotides themselves, which have three phosphates attached to them (much like the energy-carrying molecule ATP). When the bond between phosphates is broken, the energy released is used to form a bond between the incoming nucleotide and the growing chain.\n</p></div><div><p>In prokaryotes such as <em>E. coli</em>, there are two main DNA polymerases involved in DNA replication: DNA pol III (the major DNA-maker), and DNA pol I, which plays a crucial supporting role we'll examine later.</p></div></div><div><p></p><h2>Starting DNA replication</h2><p></p><div><p>How do DNA polymerases and other replication factors know where to begin? Replication always starts at specific locations on the DNA, which are called <strong>origins of replication</strong> and are recognized by their sequence.</p></div><div><p><em>E. coli</em>, like most bacteria, has a single origin of replication on its chromosome. The origin is about <span><span></span><span><span></span></span><span></span></span> base pairs long and has mostly A/T base pairs (which are held together by fewer hydrogen bonds than G/C base pairs), making the DNA strands easier to separate.</p></div><div><p>Specialized proteins recognize the origin, bind to this site, and open up the DNA. As the DNA opens, two Y-shaped structures called <strong>replication forks</strong> are formed, together making up what's called a <strong>replication bubble</strong>. The replication forks will move in opposite directions as replication proceeds. </p></div><div><p>How does replication actually get going at the forks? <strong>Helicase</strong> is the first replication enzyme to load on at the origin of replication<span><span></span><span><span></span></span><span></span></span>. Helicase's job is to move the replication forks forward by \"unwinding\" the DNA (breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs). </p></div><div><p>Proteins called <strong>single-strand binding proteins</strong> coat the separated strands of DNA near the replication fork, keeping them from coming back together into a double helix.</p></div></div><div><p></p><h2>Primers and primase</h2><p></p><div><p>DNA polymerases can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of an existing DNA strand. (They use the free -OH group found at the 3' end as a \"hook,\" adding a nucleotide to this group in the polymerization reaction.) How, then, does DNA polymerase add the first nucleotide at a new replication fork?</p></div><div><p>Alone, it can't! The problem is solved with the help of an enzyme called <strong>primase</strong>. Primase makes an RNA <strong>primer</strong>, or short stretch of nucleic acid complementary to the template, that provides a 3' end for DNA polymerase to work on. A typical primer is about five to ten nucleotides long. The primer <em>primes</em> DNA synthesis, i.e., gets it started.</p></div><div><p>Once the RNA primer is in place, DNA polymerase \"extends\" it, adding nucleotides one by one to make a new DNA strand that's complementary to the template strand.</p></div></div><div><p></p><h2>Leading and lagging strands</h2><p></p><div><p>In <em>E. coli</em>, the DNA polymerase that handles most of the synthesis is DNA polymerase III. There are two molecules of DNA polymerase III at a replication fork, each of them hard at work on one of the two new DNA strands.</p></div><div><p>DNA polymerases can only make DNA in the 5' to 3' direction, and this poses a problem during replication. A DNA double helix is always anti-parallel; in other words, one strand runs in the 5' to 3' direction, while the other runs in the 3' to 5' direction. This makes it necessary for the two new strands, which are also antiparallel to their templates, to be made in slightly different ways.</p></div><div><p>One new strand, which runs 5' to 3' towards the replication fork, is the easy one. This strand is made continuously, because the DNA polymerase is moving in the same direction as the replication fork. This continuously synthesized strand is called the <strong>leading strand</strong>.</p></div><div><p>The other new strand, which runs 5' to 3' away from the fork, is trickier. This strand is made in fragments because, as the fork moves forward, the DNA polymerase (which is moving away from the fork) must come off and reattach on the newly exposed DNA. This tricky strand, which is made in fragments, is called the <strong>lagging strand</strong>.</p></div><div><p>The small fragments are called <strong>Okazaki fragments</strong>, named for the Japanese scientist who discovered them. The leading strand can be extended from one primer alone, whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for each of the short Okazaki fragments.</p></div></div><div><p></p><h2>The maintenance and cleanup crew</h2><p></p><div><p> Some other proteins and enzymes, in addition the main ones above, are needed to keep DNA replication running smoothly. One is a protein called the <strong>sliding clamp</strong>, which holds DNA polymerase III molecules in place as they synthesize DNA. The sliding clamp is a ring-shaped protein and keeps the DNA polymerase of the lagging strand from floating off when it re-starts at a new Okazaki fragment<span><span></span><span><span></span></span><span></span></span>.</p></div><div><p><strong>Topoisomerase</strong> also plays an important maintenance role during DNA replication. This enzyme prevents the DNA double helix ahead of the replication fork from getting too tightly wound as the DNA is opened up. It acts by making temporary nicks in the helix to release the tension, then sealing the nicks to avoid permanent damage.</p></div><div><p>Finally, there is a little cleanup work to do if we want DNA that doesn't contain any RNA or gaps. The RNA primers are removed and replaced by DNA through the activity of <strong>DNA polymerase I</strong>, the other polymerase involved in replication. The nicks that remain after the primers are replaced get sealed by the enzyme <strong>DNA ligase</strong>.</p></div></div><div><p></p><h2>Summary of DNA replication in <em>E. coli</em></h2><p></p><div><p>Let's zoom out and see how the enzymes and proteins involved in replication work together to synthesize new DNA. </p></div><div><ul><li><p><strong>Helicase</strong> opens up the DNA at the replication fork.</p></li><li><p><strong>Single-strand binding prot",

It also shuffles alleles on the same chromosome into novel combinations, making it an important evolutionary force for both adaptation and maintenance of genetic diversity in populations (<span></span>Felsenstein 1974; <span></span>Otto and Lenormand 2002). Recombination is the result of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair during meiosis that can be resolved in two ways: crossovers, where large sections are reciprocally exchanged between homologous chromosomes; and gene conversions, where a given DSB in one homolog is repaired by its sister homolog, resulting in the nonreciprocal transfer of short tracts of DNA (reviewed in <span></span>Wang et al. 2015; <span></span>Lorenz and Mpaulo 2022). The mechanisms of recombination are remarkably conserved into the deep evolutionary past of animals, plants, and fungi, with homologous proteins involved in the processes of chromosome pairing, assembly of the synaptonemal complex (a protein structure that forms between paired chromosomes), DSB formation and repair via homologous recombination, and designation of crossover and noncrossover sites (reviewed in <span></span>Arter and Keeney 2024). Despite this, the genes and proteins involved in these processes show remarkable variation in their sequence and function even between closely related species (<span></span>Gerton and Hawley 2005; <span></span>Kumar et al. 2010; <span></span>Keeney et al. 2014; <span></span>Dapper and Payseur 2019; <span></span>Arter and Keeney 2024).</p><p>This is reflected in the vast diversity in the rate and distribution of recombination events across eukaryotes, which is manifest in different ways. The rate and distribution of recombination often vary within and between taxonomic groups, species, and populations (<span></span>Price and Bantock 1975; <span></span>Stapley et al. 2017; <span></span>Samuk et al. 2020). They can vary between individuals of the same population, often due to genetic differences between them (<span></span>Kong et al. 2014; <span></span>Brekke et al. 2023). They can be markedly different between females and males in the same species (<span></span>Lenormand and Dutheil 2005), and even in female and male gametes from the same hermaphroditic individual (<span></span>Theodosiou et al. 2016). They also vary relative to broad and fine-scale features of the genome (<span></span>Haenel et al. 2018; <span></span>Brazier and Glémin 2022), and often occur in narrow recombination “hotspots” throughout the genome (reviewed in <span></span>Choi and Henderson 2015; <span></span>Zelkowski et al. 2019). Finally, they can be plastic, varying with individual and environmental factors such as age, temperature, infection status, and oxidative stress (reviewed in <span></span>Bomblies et al. 2015; <span></span>Rybnikov et al. 2023).</p><p>Understanding the causes and consequences of this diversity has been of interest to molecular and evolutionary biologists for more than a century (<span></span><a href=\"#msae112-box1\">Box 1</a>). This is because recombination occurs at a critical point in the life cycle, and its direct outcomes may impact individual fertility and the health of offspring (<span></span>Hassold and Hunt 2001; <span></span>Berg et al. 2010; <span></span>Lachance and Tishkoff 2014). Furthermore, many evolutionary processes are influenced by recombination, including aspects of adaptive evolution (<span></span>Gossmann et al. 2014; <span></span>Castellano et al. 2016; <span></span>Kosheleva and Desai 2018; <span></span>Rousselle et al. 2019), effects of background selection (<span></span>Booker et al. 2022), mutation rates (<span></span>Duret and Arndt 2008; <span></span>Hinch et al. 2023), sex chromosome evolution (<span></span>Charlesworth 2017; <span></span>Olito and Abbott 2023), hybridization and the fate of introgressed alleles (<span></span>Martin and Jiggins 2017; <span></span>Schumer et al. 2018; <span></span>Duranton and Pool 2022), and speciation (<span></span>Ortiz-Barrientos et al. 2016). However, understanding how and why variation in recombination <em>itself</em> has evolved remains a constant challenge, and there are still open questions on if recombination is adaptive, stochastic, and/or evolving as a consequence of selection on correlated traits (reviewed in <span></span>Lenormand et al. 2016; <span></span>Ritz et al. 2017; <span></span>Henderson and Bomblies 2021). Whilst much progress has been made, quantifying recombination has been challenging, and much of our understanding was limited to a handful of model species (<span></span><a href=\"#msae112-box1\">Box 1</a>). Nevertheless, advances in technologies and methodologies over the last decades have led to new insights accumulating at an impressive pace across a diverse range of systems (reviewed in <span></span>Stapley et al. 2017; <span></span>Peñalba and Wolf 2020).</p><div><p><span>Box 1.</span></p><div><p>A brief history of understanding and measuring recombination.</p></div><p>The crossover process was first proposed more than a century ago, through experiments of Alfred Sturtevant on the co-inheritance of alleles controlling mutant phenotypes in <em>D. melanogaster</em>, while he was a student in the laboratory of Thomas Hunt Morgan (<span></span>Sturtevant 1913). Later, Harriet Creighton and Barbara McClintock validated this concept in cytological experiments in maize (<span></span>Creighton and McClintock 1931).

And all of these populations are likely to be evolving for at least some of their genes. Evolution is happening right here, right now!</p></div><div><p>To be clear, that doesn't mean these populations are marching towards some final state of perfection. All <strong>evolution</strong> means is that a population is changing in its genetic makeup over generations. And the changes may be subtle—for instance, in a wolf population, there might be a shift in the frequency of a gene variant for black rather than gray fur. Sometimes, this type of change is due to natural selection. Other times, it comes from migration of new organisms into the population, or from random events—the evolutionary \"luck of the draw.\"</p></div><div><p>In this article, we'll examine what it means for a population evolve, see the (rarely met) set of conditions required for a population <em>not</em> to evolve, and explore how failure to meet these conditions does in fact lead to evolution.</p></div></div><div><p></p><h2>Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium</h2><p></p><div><p>First, let's see what it looks like when a population is <em>not</em> evolving. If a population is in a state called <strong>Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium</strong>, the frequencies of <strong>alleles</strong>, or gene versions, and <strong>genotypes</strong>, or sets of alleles, in that population will stay the same over generations (and will also satisfy the <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/her/heredity-and-genetics/v/applying-hardy-weinberg\">Hardy-Weinberg equation</a>). Formally, evolution is a change in allele frequencies in a population over time, so a population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is not evolving.</p></div><div><p>That's a little bit abstract, so let's break it down using an example. Imagine we have a large population of beetles. In fact, just for the heck of it, let's say this population is <em>infinitely</em> large. The beetles of our infinitely large population come in two colors, dark gray and light gray, and their color is determined by the <em>A</em> gene. <em>AA</em> and <em>Aa</em> beetles are dark gray, and <em>aa</em> beetles are light gray.</p></div><div><p>In our population, let's say that the <em>A</em> allele has a frequency of <span><span></span><span><span></span></span><span></span></span>, while the <em>a</em> allele has a frequency of <span><span></span><span><span></span></span><span></span></span>. If a population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, allele frequencies will be related to genotype frequencies by a specific mathematical relationship, the Hardy-Weinberg equation. So, we can predict the genotype frequencies we'd expect to see (<em>if</em> the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium) by plugging in allele frequencies as shown below:</p></div><div><p>Let's imagine that these are, in fact, the genotype frequencies we see in our beetle population (<span><span></span><span><span></span></span><span></span></span> <em>AA</em>, <span><span></span><span><span></span></span><span></span></span> <em>Aa</em>, <span><span></span><span><span></span></span><span></span></span> <em>aa</em>). Excellent—our beetles appear to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium! Now, let's imagine that the beetles reproduce to make a next generation. What will the allele and genotype frequencies will be in that generation?</p></div><div><p>To predict this, we need to make a few assumptions:</p></div><div><p>First, let's assume that none of the genotypes is any better than the others at surviving or getting mates. If this is the case, the frequency of <em>A</em> and <em>a</em> alleles in the pool of gametes (sperm and eggs) that meet to make the next generation will be the same as the overall frequency of each allele in the present generation.</p></div><div><p>Second, let's assume that the beetles mate randomly (as opposed to, say, black beetles preferring other black beetles). If this is the case, we can think of reproduction as the result of two random events: selection of a sperm from the population's gene pool and selection of an egg from the same gene pool. The probability of getting any offspring genotype is just the probability of getting the egg and sperm combo(s) that produce that genotype.</p></div><div><p>We can use a modified Punnett square to represent the likelihood of getting different offspring genotypes. Here, we multiply the frequencies of the gametes on the axes to get the probability of the fertilization events in the squares:</p></div><div><p>As shown above, we'd predict an offspring generation with the exact same genotype frequencies as the parent generation: <span><span></span><span><span></span></span><span></span></span> <em>AA</em>, <span><span></span><span><span></span></span><span></span></span> <em>Aa</em>, and <span><span></span><span><span></span></span><span></span></span> <em>aa</em>. If genotype frequencies have not changed, we also must have the same allele frequencies as in the parent generation: <span><span></span><span><span></span></span><span></span></span> for <em>A</em> and <span><span></span><span><span></span></span><span></span></span> for <em>a</em>.</p></div><div><p>What we've just seen is the essence of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. If alleles in the gamete pool exactly mirror those in the parent generation, and if they meet up randomly (in an infinitely large number of events), there is no reason—in fact, no way—for allele and genotype frequencies to change from one generation to the next.</p></div><div><p>In the absence of other factors, you can imagine this process repeating over and over, generation after generation, keeping allele and genotype frequencies the same. Since <strong>evolution</strong> is a change in allele frequencies in a population over generations, a population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is, by definition, not evolving.</p></div><p></p><h2>But is that realistic?</h2><p></p><div><p>As we mentioned at the beginning of the article, populations are usually not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (at least, not for all of the genes in their genome). Instead, populations tend to evolve: the allele frequencies of at least some of their genes change from one generation to the next.</p></div><div><p>In fact, population geneticists often check to see if a population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium <em>because</em> they suspect other forces may be at work. If the population’s allele and genotype frequencies are changing over generations (or if the allele and genotype frequencies don't match the predictions of the Hardy-Weinberg equation), the race is on to find out why.</p></div></div><div><p></p><h2>Hardy-Weinberg assumptions and evolution</h2><p></p><div><p>What causes populations to evolve? In order for a population to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, or a non-evolving state, it must meet five major assumptions:</p></div><div><ol><li><p><strong>No mutation.</strong> No new alleles are generated by mutation, nor are genes duplicated or deleted.</p></li><li><p><strong>Random mating.</strong> Organisms mate randomly with each other, with no preference for particular genotypes.</p></li><li><p><strong>No gene flow.</strong> Neither individuals nor their gametes (e.g., windborne pollen) enter or exit the population.</p></li><li><p><strong>Very large population size.</strong> The population should be effectively infinite in size.</p></li><li><p><strong>No natural selection.</strong> All alleles confer equal fitness (make organisms equally likely to survive and reproduce).</p></li></ol></div><div><p>If any one of these assumptions is not met, the population will not be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Instead, it may evolve: allele frequencies may change from one generation to the next. Allele and genotype frequencies within a single generation may also fail to satisfy the Hardy-Weinberg equation.</p></div></div><div><p></p><h2>Some genes may satisfy Hardy-Weinberg, while others do not</h2><p></p><div><p>Note that we can think about Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in two ways: for just one gene, or for all the genes in the genome.</p></div><div><ul><li><p>If we look at just one gene, we check whether the above criteria are true <em>for that one gene</em>. For example, we would ask if there were mutations in that gene, or if organisms mated randomly with regards to their genotype for that gene.</p></li><li><p>If we look at <em>all the genes in the genome</em>, the conditions have to be met for every single gene.</p></li></ul></div><div><p>While it’s possible that the conditions will be more or less met for a single gene under certain circumstances, it’s very unlikely that they would be met for all the genes in the genome.

Here, we addressed these issues within a surprisingly short evolutionary timescale (&lt;1 million years for 97% of <em>Oryza</em> de novo genes) with comparative approaches to gene duplicates. We found that de novo genes evolve faster than gene duplicates in the intrinsically disordered regions (such as random coils), secondary structure elements (such as α helix and β strand), hydrophobicity, and molecular recognition features. In de novo proteins, specifically, we observed an 8% to 14% decay in random coils and intrinsically disordered region lengths and a 2.3% to 6.5% increase in structured elements, hydrophobicity, and molecular recognition features, per million years on average. These patterns of structural evolution align with changes in amino acid composition over time as well.

Important to this is the emergence of de novo genes (<a href=\"#evae107-B55\">Long et al. 2003</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B1\">Alba and Castresana 2005</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B50\">Levine et al. 2006</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B58\">McLysaght and Hurst 2016</a>)—genes that arise from regions of DNA once categorized as the “junk” that used to be considered functionally insignificant (<a href=\"#evae107-B67\">Ohno 1972</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B29\">Fagundes et al. 2022</a>). The birth of de novo genes was deemed impossible or functionally irrelevant (<a href=\"#evae107-B41\">Jacob 1977</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B57\">Mayr 1982</a>). However, recent studies in rice, flies, yeast, fishes, and mammals, with reports of many candidate de novo genes, have challenged this dogma and provided concrete evidence that de novo genes can indeed emerge from noncoding sequences through a stepwise mutational process, contributing to increased protein diversity (<a href=\"#evae107-B46\">Knowles and McLysaght 2009</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B102\">Zhao et al. 2014</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B93\">Xie et al. 2019</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B100\">Zhang et al. 2019</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B105\">Zhuang et al. 2019</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B37\">Heames et al. 2020</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B84\">Vakirlis et al. 2022</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B3\">An et al. 2023</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B62\">Montañés et al. 2023</a>). Despite these progresses, our understanding of these novel proteins, particularly their structural characteristics at the secondary, tertiary, and complex levels, and the rate of their structural evolution, remains largely unexplored.</p>\n<p>Gene duplicates have long been recognized as a predominant source of new gene functions (<a href=\"#evae107-B56\">Long et al. 2013</a>). These duplicates retain sequences from their parent genes and contribute to phenotypic evolution through various mechanisms, including neofunctionalization, hypofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, and gene dosage regulation (<a href=\"#evae107-B66\">Ohno 1970</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B45\">Kaessmann 2010</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B7\">Birchler and Yang 2022</a>). In contrast, de novo genes evolve through nonduplication mechanisms and have been shown to play diverse roles in biological functions. Their contributions have been highlighted in multiple systems, for example, DNA repair in yeast (<a href=\"#evae107-B15\">Cai et al. 2008</a>), providing a novel antifreeze function in Arctic fish (<a href=\"#evae107-B104\">Zhuang and Cheng 2021</a>), diversification of rice morphology (<a href=\"#evae107-B18\">Chen et al. 2023</a>), flora transition in <em>Arabidopsis</em> (<a href=\"#evae107-B78\">Takeda et al. 2023</a>), cortical expansion in humans (<a href=\"#evae107-B3\">An et al. 2023</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B70\">Qi et al. 2023</a>), and even oncogenesis in human cancers (<a href=\"#evae107-B77\">Suenaga et al. 2014</a>). The emergence and functional diversity of de novo genes introduce a novel dimension to our understanding of genome evolution and functional innovation, expanding our knowledge beyond traditional gene duplication models (<a href=\"#evae107-B46\">Knowles and McLysaght 2009</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B16\">Carvunis et al. 2012</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B102\">Zhao et al. 2014</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B100\">Zhang et al. 2019</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B84\">Vakirlis et al. 2022</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B12\">Broeils et al. 2023</a>).</p>\n<p>Due to their relatively recent origins, it can be hypothesized that de novo proteins may not have evolved into well-folded structure (<a href=\"#evae107-B10\">Bornberg-Bauer et al. 2021</a>). This would lead to a characteristic feature: a lack of stable tertiary structure when isolated, thus manifesting as intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) or regions of random coils. It is found that vertebrate species with a higher codon adaptation index score evolve more ISD domains (<a href=\"#evae107-B88\">Weibel et al. 2023</a>). ISD is also commonly found in proteins related to human genetic diseases (<a href=\"#evae107-B61\">Midic et al. 2009</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B86\">Vavouri et al. 2009</a>). Despite advancements in functional studies of ISD proteins, the extent of ISD in de novo genes remains a subject of debate. Several studies suggest a strong tendency toward ISD in de novo genes or newly evolved domains (<a href=\"#evae107-B8\">Bitard-Feildel et al. 2015</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B6\">Basile et al. 2017</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B92\">Wilson et al. 2017</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B37\">Heames et al. 2020</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B48\">Lange et al. 2021</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B36\">Heames et al. 2023</a>). Conversely, other studies present inconsistent results due to different average disorders in different species (<a href=\"#evae107-B26\">Ekman and Elofsson 2010</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B74\">Schmitz et al. 2018</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B83\">Vakirlis et al. 2018</a>). The question of whether ISD is influenced by gene age or if it can evolve over time remains unresolved.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the evolvability of well-folded structural elements in de novo genes, such as, 3<sub>10</sub> helices, α helices, and β strands, remains an open question. Are the amino acid compositions of de novo proteins optimized for structural stability over time? Recently, AlphaFold2 stands as the leading deep learning tool for predicting protein structures utilizing coevolutionary information from multiple sequence alignments (<a href=\"#evae107-B44\">Jumper et al. 2021</a>). MD (molecular dynamics) simulation studies have revealed that most de novo proteins are flexible in structure and a minority of them adopt well-known protein structures (<a href=\"#evae107-B59\">Middendorf and Eicholt 2024</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B69\">Peng and Zhao 2024</a>). Despite the tendency of de novo proteins to be disordered with few (or no) orthologs, AlphaFold2's predictions reveal that they generally achieve higher-confidence scores per residue (predicted local distance difference test [pLDDT]) than random sequences (<a href=\"#evae107-B60\">Middendorf et al. 2024</a>). The AlphaFold2 performs the MD refinement (called “relax” in AlphaFold2 terminology) using OpenMM (<a href=\"#evae107-B44\">Jumper et al. 2021</a>). In addition, a benchmarking study based on 2,613 proteins with experimentally determined structures indicates that AlphaFold2 is a good predictor of the structure of loop regions (regions of neither α helices nor β strands), especially for short loop regions (<a href=\"#evae107-B76\">Stevens and He 2022</a>). The pLDDT score is an excellent metric for assessing modeling confidence, disorder levels, and structural variability (<a href=\"#evae107-B73\">Saldaño et al. 2022</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B91\">Wilson et al. 2022</a>), with AlphaFold2 demonstrating a significant correlation between pLDDT scores and the presence of secondary structures in disorder-rich proteins, both globally and locally (<a href=\"#evae107-B91\">Wilson et al. 2022</a>). Recent studies showed that model quality can be estimated by generating many structure models for the same protein and quantifying the structural similarities among the models by TM (template modeling) score (<a href=\"#evae107-B64\">Mukherjee and Zhang 2009</a>; <a href=\"#evae107-B69\">Peng and Zhao 2024</a>). These findings suggest AlphaFold2's pivotal role in elucidating the biological implications of de novo proteins, which are predominantly characterized by variable structural changes.</p>\n<p>Another rising question is whether or how de novo pr",

Important to this is the emergence of de novo genes (Long et al. 2003;Alba and Castresana 2005;Levine et al. 2006;McLysaght and Hurst 2016)—genes that arise from regions of DNA once categorized as the “junk” that used to be considered functionally insignificant (Ohno 1972;Fagundes et al. 2022). The birth of de novo genes was deemed impossible or functionally irrelevant",
