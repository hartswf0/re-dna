The human body is a prime example of a dynamic and resilient system we can all relate to. A community, a nation’s food supply, or a product’s life cycle are similarly complex systems, meaning they are in a constant state of adaptive transformation. Sometimes systems collapse. A sustainable system is resilient enough to continue performing its intended function (though this can also change over time.) <br/></p><p><b>The System Level: Setting Boundaries</b></p><p>The system level of a ‘system’ refers to the determined limits of a system. It sets a focus for analysis and limits what to include to avoid never-ending deliberation. It contains both the network and object levels.</p><p>A system’s boundary can be a region’s borders, a timeline, or a product’s life cycle. As they are dynamic and effectively ‘living’ in reality, the parameters of a system are constantly shifting. Likewise, boundaries need to be reassessed and can also change over time. </p><p><b>A Dynamic and Adaptive Edge</b></p><p>It’s important to have limits to a system before analysis. However, due to behaviors like a change in climate, new or obsolete roles, or the birth and decay of natural resources, this defined ‘edge’ must be flexible – particularly in the beginning.</p><p>For example, an urban planner studying the transportation network of a particular neighborhood must look beyond the immediate community and include the surrounding region or the entire city of which the district is intrinsically a part. </p><p>As an assessment moves on, the system’s limit can be modified to allow for simplification or, in some circumstances, include more factors. When beginning, and to ensure all relevant aspects are captured, it’s recommended to create a system’s boundary at least one step beyond the assumed boundary of the issue. </p><p><b>Crafting sustainable systems</b></p><p>Understanding systems is one thing. Making them sustainable is another. The SiD framework helps to analyze the current state of the system, which then provides insight in how to act to increase the sustainability of it. It regards three main optimization areas that each influence each other; the system's Resilience, the system's Autonomy, and the system's Harmony. Resilience defines the ability of a system to withstand unexpected events from outside. Autonomy determines the capability for the system to take care of its continuing needs. Harmony defines the ability of the system to withstand internal collapse through conflict inside the system. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<figcaption>It’s essential to have a determined boundary for systems analysis. However, much like dynamic systems grow and change – both over time and physical space – so is the need to account for additional factors and adjust the limits that define them.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><b>Externalities Beyond a System</b></p><p>A system’s boundary simplifies the scope of analysis and is essential, though it must remain flexible, primarily to include and account for externalities. Externalities refer to unintended or unaccounted consequences from production, consumption, or operations that affect factors beyond a defined system. Generally, this refers to effects on natural resources, public health, and well-being and revealed in outcomes like pollution, deforestation, or diminished human rights. </p><p><b>In summary</b></p><p>The system level is the most abstract of the three layers but is where impacts are most apparent. Therefore, it can be the most insightful. For a complete systems analysis and a shift toward systemic and integrated sustainability, it’s vital to define and evaluate a system’s boundary. However, to account for dynamic change and external effects, the exact edges of a system must remain flexible and dynamic. The next installment on the anatomy of a system will discuss the “object level.” </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>\n</p><h2>Thinking in Systems Part 2: the Object Level</h2>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>Whether well-versed or just beginning to learn about systems thinking, it’s often a confusing and complex endeavor. However, it’s essential to grasp – especially if one is to understand how the world works and implement truly sustainable change.</p><p>The previous part introduced the concept of a system, the SNO (System, Network, Object) hierarchy utilized in the SiD integrated systems thinking framework, and discussed the importance of setting a system’s boundary.

For example, if we take an office space, the objects are everything you can point to and name, such as the building, furniture, carpets, equipment, people, notebooks, etc. The properties of these objects are generally defined by size, mass, color, and material composition and rarely change unless via an external force.</p><p>This object level is where sustainability is commonly encountered or approached through sustainable development, addressing things such as energy use, materials, economic impacts, and climate change.</p><p>The Triple Bottom Line, also referred to as the “Three P’s” (People, Planet, Profit), emerged in the early days of sustainability science and is still used to categorize sustainable projects. While impactful, this approach covers too few categories, masks the complexity and interconnectedness of systems, and falls short as a tool for a complete systems approach to sustainable analysis and design.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<figcaption>The ELSI stack, from the SiD systems thinking framework, is an example of a practical and holistic object categorization tool. It covers the full spectrum of society and allows users to quickly develop areas of interest and indicator sets for systems analysis.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><b>Categorization From a Systems Thinking Perspective</b></p><p>For genuinely sustainable analysis and solutions, the objects within a defined system need to be known, observed, and understood in relation to each other.

A marketing project would instead focus on how outreach and behavioral impacts.</p><p>Because of the almost limitless variety of ‘objects’ across projects, it’s impossible to define a standard set of indicators. Nevertheless, it’s essential to account for the full spectrum of societal impacts, and the most efficient way to do this is via a categorization tool.</p><p>A categorization tool can be helpful as a guide to map and develop relevant indicators that fit each unique task and help develop roadmaps to genuinely sustainable actions and outcomes – as long as the tool covers the entire system to be analyzed.</p><p><b>Summary</b></p><p>After setting a system’s boundary, it’s essential to recognize the objects within said system related to the issue or project at hand.

This theory was introduced in the Seventies by the two Chilean biologists Humberto R. Maturana and Francisco J. Varela (Maturana and Varela <a href=\"#CR27\">1980</a>). Within the context of SB and the construction of synthetic cells, autopoiesis is an extremely powerful conceptual tool to define in general terms what are the structural and functional requirements of a molecular biosystems in order to mimic the basic living features of natural ones. The analysis is particularly simple when we focus on the lowest complexity level, namely the single cell. A minimal autopoietic system can be described by the cartoon shown in Fig. <a href=\"#Fig1\">1</a>. The system (e.g., an autopoietic cell) can be seen as a self-bounded molecular assembly, characterized by the following dynamics. Components from the environment (A, B) are assimilated by the structure (dashed arrows) and transformed into the components of the cell (S, M). Together with these transformations, which are actually anabolic processes, waste material is produced (Y, W) by catabolic processes. It is possible to define two main processes: (1) synthesis of the boundary components (A to S) and self-assembly of S into a semi-permeable membrane; (2) synthesis of all internal components (M) at the expenses of B (B to M and W). Thanks to these two processes, which are actually coupled, the autopoietic cell: (1) constructs its own boundary; (2) constructs all other internal components, which in turn give rise to processes that produce all components, that in turn give rise to processes … and so on. The functions of the autopoietic cell are therefore defined recursively according to a circular logic. Notably, the whole system is out-of-equilibrium and thermodynamically open, because it exists only in the act of continuously transforming the nutrients (A, B) into the waste products (Y, B), and by exploiting the free energy of this transformation in order to maintain its internal <em>organization</em>. It is important to remark that, despite the ceaseless formation and destruction of the elements (lower hierarchical level) of the autopoietic system, the whole system (at an higher hierarchical level) maintains its own identity. The autopoietic cell is a <em>self</em>-<em>organizing</em> entity where its main features (self-producing, self-bounding, homeostasis) are <em>emergent</em> properties. Another important aspect of autopoietic systems, is that in their description it is not needed to identify a central control unit, because the property of being autopoietic is not associated with a particular molecule or function, but stems from the coordinated and collective system dynamics, which is also strongly coupled with the environment. Figure <a href=\"#Fig1\">1</a> also tells us that depending on the relative rate of anabolic and catabolic processes, the autopoietic cell can grow, stays in homeostatic state, or dies, depending on which aspect of metabolism is prevailing in certain conditions.</p>\n<figure><h3>Fig. 1.</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&amp;p=PMC3&amp;id=2955203_11693_2010_9054_Fig1_HTML.jpg\"></a></p>\n<figcaption><p>Schematic drawing of an autopoietic cell.

A permeates in the cell, and it is transformed—by means of a metabolic network M, into S. S also decay to a waste product (Y), which does not take part in the autopoietic organization, and it is released into the environment. In order to be fully self-producing, the autopoietic cell must also produce (self-produce) the network M, at the expenses of precursors B and so producing the by products W.

Moving away from the reductionist frameworks and the complicated domain predominated by known unknowns and order, a call is being made to the social sciences to begin adopting complexity theory and newer connectionist methods that better address complexity and open social systems.

Given that multi-projects dominate project management, with some data estimating that multi-projects constitute as high as 90% of projects, Aritua et al. [<a href=\"#B5-systems-07-00004\">5</a>] have challenged the discipline of project management to draw on research from complex, dynamical systems and from complexity theory to gain new insights into developing new techniques and methodologies. Similarly, other disciplines have been called to take the ecosystem approach, as in Gregory, Atkins, Burdon, and Elliott’s [<a href=\"#B6-systems-07-00004\">6</a>] study on marine management. The ecosystem approach utilizes complex science by calling for a shift from reductionistic research (e.g., single-species research), compartmentalized decision making, and policy formulation to one that recognizes complex systems with multiple elements (e.g., ecological, social, economic, and political) [<a href=\"#B6-systems-07-00004\">6</a>].</p><p>Traditional sciences have utilized a reductionistic framework or a realist philosophy [<a href=\"#B7-systems-07-00004\">7</a>], in which an entity is reduced to its smaller parts.

Although this reductionistic framework has served science well in the past, such as during the Industrial Revolution [<a href=\"#B4-systems-07-00004\">4</a>], it is inadequate to serve science well today due to the complexities of the modern world (e.g., increasing wicked problems, global warming, information overload, globalization, and geopolitical unrest). Complexity science expands on the reductionistic framework by not only understanding the parts that contribute to the whole but by understanding how each part interacts with all the other parts and emerges into a new entity, thus having a more comprehensive and complete understanding of the whole. Individual causal research in complex systems is near futile; a comprehensive approach is required to account for the unpredictability found in complex systems [<a href=\"#B7-systems-07-00004\">7</a>]. New theoretical models that reflect “real-life complexity” are being called for by researchers [<a href=\"#B8-systems-07-00004\">8</a>] (p. 162).

Today, for example, HRD still identifies systems theory as one of its foundational theories even after many disciplines have shifted to complexity theory via complex adaptive systems due to the changing and complex environment in which they operate. Disciplines have been forced to address open systems and more complex problems (e.g., wicked problems) as opposed to employing the traditional reductionistic methods used last century. Comparably, highlighted within HR and other social science literatures, systems theory has been identified as more of a myth than a foundational theory, partly due to its disconnect between practice and theory and to its overwhelming use of linear methods when examining social systems [<a href=\"#B9-systems-07-00004\">9</a>].</p><p>The current article identifies the differences between general systems theory (GST), complex adaptive systems, and complexity theory.

More specifically, our mixed method incorporates both topic modeling and\nsystematic hand-coding of manuscripts. The outcome is a synthesized mapping of\nadaptation scholarship (443 manuscripts), organized around six theoretical streams\n(e.g., resource based, evolutionary, sociological perspectives) that tackle four\nhigh-level themes: “resources, search, and behavioral change”; “routines,\ncapabilities, and knowledge”; “governance and stakeholder management”; and\n“competitive and institutional pressures.”</p>\n<p>Second, we use our mapping to identify the three primary areas of inquiry that\nadaptation scholars have covered: why organizations pursue adaptation, what\ninternal factors preclude or enable adaptation, and what environmental factors\nurge adaptation.

The concept was introduced by Chilean biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela to describe the nature of living systems in general and the organic cell more specifically. In their definition of autopoietic systems, Maturana and Varela stress both the self-production of the system's elements and its boundary in space (Maturana and Varela, 1980, p. 79).

The social system, according to Luhmann, consists of communications which produce subsequent communications on the basis of existing social structures. For instance, social conventions structure how to respond to questions, orders and statements. Such conventions, however, can never exhaustively determine the following communications, so that there is always an element of contingency involved in the system. That is, the system's complexity entails that it must <em>select</em> some communications over others, i.e. the system must necessarily reduce complexity. The first and foremost way in which the social system reduces complexity is by drawing a boundary or distinction between itself and its outside, between system and environment.

In this way, the social system is an autopoietic system: it generates its own elements as well as its own boundary.</p>\n<p>As described, the system produces itself by distinguishing between system and environment. Since the system itself draws this distinction, the system/environment distinction is, technically speaking, drawn on the system-side of a prior system/environment distinction. This means that, when the system observes its environment, it actually observes itself. The system thus achieves '<em>operational closure</em>': it operates solely on the basis of its own self-produced structures rather than on input it receives directly from the outside. 'Irritations' from the outside environment can only be handled by the system if they can be translated or coded into order, or information, that is, if they can be systematised into the stream of '<em>recursive</em>' communications that is the system. In studying the social system, then, we are dealing with second-order observation. We are communicating about communications about communications. This self-referentiality installs a paradox at the heart of the system, since all self-reference must ultimately end in a paradox (e.g. 'This sentence is a lie').

One measure of utility of Systems Engineering activities is the degree to which such risk is\nreduced. Conversely, a measure of acceptability of absence of a System Engineering activity is the level of\nexcess risk incurred as a result.\nTRANSDISCIPLINARY APPROACH\nTransdisciplinarity is described in Wikipedia as an approach which “crosses many disciplinary boundaries to\ncreate a holistic approach.” This emphasis on a holistic approach distinguishes it from cross-disciplinary, which\nfocuses mainly on working across multiple disciplines while allowing each discipline to apply their own methods\nand approaches. Systems engineering is simultaneously cross-disciplinary and transdisciplinary. (The cross\u0002disciplinary aspect is discussed in the next section on the Integrative Approach.)\n6\n®\nSystems Engineering and System Definitions\nINCOSE-TP-| 22 July 2019\nThe transdisciplinary approach originated in the social sciences. It “transcends” all of the disciplines involved,\nand organizes the effort around common purpose, shared understanding and “learning together” in the context\nof real-world problems or themes. It is usable at any level, from complex to simple, from global to personal. A\ntransdisciplinary approach is needed when the problem cannot readily be “solved” and the best that can likely\nbe achieved is instead a “resolution.” The participants in the endeavor need to “transcend” their particular\ndisciplinary approach to instead come to some overall useful compromise or synergistic understanding that\ntheir disciplines cannot come to on their own (even when working together in a normal integrative approach\nwith other disciplines).\nINTEGRATIVE APPROACH\nThe integrative approach has long been used in systems engineering and usually involves either\ninterdisciplinary (e.g.. integrated product teams) or multi-disciplinary (e.g.. joint technical reviews) methods.\nThe integrative approach by itself can be adequate where the situation is not overly complex and there are\nsmaller numbers of stakeholders potentially impacted. The integrative approach can be used when dealing\nwith a highly precedented situation that has been encountered before and a path to the solution can be readily\nidentified and understood (albeit there will still be many challenges along the way, technical and otherwise).\nThe integrative approach includes the traditional multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary approaches commonly\nused in systems engineering practice. The transdisciplinary approach may be needed in unprecedented\nsituations or where there is a significant degree of complexity involved. See Madni (2018).\nSYSTEMS PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\nSystems principles and concepts are the ways that systems thinking and the systems sciences infuse systems\nengineering. Examples of some of the principles, concepts and supporting tools are: mental models, system\narchetypes, holistic thinking, separation of concerns, abstraction, modularity and encapsulation, causal loop\ndiagrams, and systems mapping.

Mark Neumann sums up autoethnography as,\n“texts (that) democratize the representational sphere of culture, by locating the particular experiences\nof individuals in a tension with dominant expressions of discursive power” (Neumann, 1996 p. 189).\nDuring this process, the personal becomes political (Holman Jones, 2008).\nFor autoethnography to be fully recognised as a method of knowledge creation in other communities,\nsciences, and domains that are biased towards more traditional research paradigms, the subjective\nexperiences need to be explored and expressed in commercial and public organisations alike and\naccepted as equally relevant.

I argue that rational economic thinking and traditional\nresearch approaches do not sufficiently recognise the individual experience as a source of knowledge\ncreation. Through autoethnographic accounts, I describe my emergent sense of self during a four-year\nperiod as I moved from international organisational consultant to becoming a reluctant academic,\nwith an acceptance and recognition that we are all knowledge creators.

But I was unprepared\nfor my personal journey of change, and how this would affect me emotionally and physically. Let me\nshare what I consider to be my first inner experience of Autopoiesis:\nAnne Rød 3\n“Two months into my second year in the doctoral programme, I started to experience an\ninner feeling of discombobulation. It was as if parts of my body detached themselves from\ntheir moorings and started to float around in the oceans of my inside.

It explained that I could continue to learn by revisiting my\nlife, simultaneously embracing new perspectives while responding differently, because I\nwas in the process of becoming someone else” (Rød, 2020 p. 145-146).\nI was struck by the visceral experience of becoming someone else. This was a different type of\nknowledge, scary and expansive at the same time, and not one that could have been captured\nadequately by an outside observer. I found resonance in the Theory of Autopoiesis, which describes\nlife and cognitive processes and how we constantly recreate ourselves. According to this theory, we\nhumans, are living, autopoietic systems engaged in processes of cognition (Maturana and Varela,\n1980) that enables us to learn, develop and mature continuously.\nThe experience shook my foundations and identity, and I became intrigued by how we can use\ndifferent interpretations of Autopoiesis, be it biological, cognitive, systemic, or social, to explore the\nknowledge created through our lived experiences. By combining the argument that disruption creates\nshifts (Alvesson and Karreman, 2011; Cunliffe, 2018) and shifts produce new awareness (Shotter,\n2011), with the scientific understanding of molecular change in autopoiesis as a metaphor and an\nanalogy, we can better understand how our sense of self is structured and restructured through our\ninteractions with the environment. Gregory Bateson (1979) argued that epistemology always is\npersonal (Karlsson et al., 2019) and that this makes us all explorers and creators of knowledge. Olson\n(2015) added that autoethnography engages an exploration of changes within ourselves that can be\nrelated to larger social, political, and cultural events (Olson, 2015).\nWhat counts as knowledge?\nThe contextualisation of our personal experiences and processes, implies that our sense of self, and\nperception of identity, are constructed and negotiated between self and the domains of which we are\na part. We start to ask ourselves if our voices count and what knowledge is correct (Karlsson et al.,\n2019) and for whom, even questioning who we are and if it matters. This transports us to the\nhegemony of power, where according to Foucault (1999) the dominant voices determine the direction\nand content of the discourses, establishing a basis for their power and positionality on knowledge. As\nwe move between different levels, from macro to micro, from socio-cultural to ourselves (Allen\u0002Collinson, 2013), we become ontological and epistemological vehicles for knowledge creation.

The purpose of this appendix is to describe the second dimension—\ncrosscutting concepts—and to explain its role in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).\nThe Framework identifies seven crosscutting concepts that bridge disciplinary boundaries, uniting\ncore ideas throughout the fields of science and engineering. Their purpose is to help students deepen\ntheir understanding of the disciplinary core ideas (pp. 2 and 8), and develop a coherent and\nscientifically based view of the world (p. 83.) The seven crosscutting concepts presented in Chapter\n4 of the Framework are as follows:\n1. Patterns. Observed patterns of forms and events guide organization and classification, and\nthey prompt questions about relationships and the factors that influence them.\n2. Cause and effect: Mechanism and explanation. Events have causes, sometimes simple,\nsometimes multifaceted.

Such mechanisms can then be\ntested across given contexts and used to predict and explain events in new contexts.\n3. Scale, proportion, and quantity.

For natural and built systems alike, conditions of stability and\ndeterminants of rates of change or evolution of a system are critical elements of study.\nThe Framework notes that crosscutting concepts are featured prominently in other documents about\nwhat all students should learn about science for the past two decades. These have been called\n“themes” in Science for All Americans (AAA 1989) and Benchmarks for Science Literacy (1993),\n“unifying principles” in National Science Education Standards (1996), and “crosscutting ideas”\nNSTA’s Science Anchors Project (2010). Although these ideas have been consistently included in\nprevious standards documents the Framework recognizes that “students have often been expected to\nApril 2013 NGSS Release Page 2 of 17\nbuild such knowledge without any explicit instructional support. Hence the purpose of highlighting\nthem as Dimension 2 of the framework is to elevate their role in the development of standards,\ncurricula, instruction, and assessments.” (p. 83) The writing team has continued this commitment by\nweaving crosscutting concepts into the performance expectations for all students—so they cannot\nbe left out.\nGuiding Principles\nThe Framework recommended crosscutting concepts be embedded in the science curriculum\nbeginning in the earliest years of schooling and suggested a number of guiding principles for how\nthey should be used. The development process of the standards provided insights into the\ncrosscutting concepts. These insights are shared in the following guiding principles.\nCrosscutting concepts can help students better understand core ideas in science and\nengineering. When students encounter new phenomena, whether in a science lab, field trip, or on\ntheir own, they need mental tools to help engage in and come to understand the phenomena from a\nscientific point of view. Familiarity with crosscutting concepts can provide that perspective. For\nexample, when approaching a complex phenomenon (either a natural phenomenon or a machine) an\napproach that makes sense is to begin by observing and characterizing the phenomenon in terms of\npatterns. A next step might be to simplify the phenomenon by thinking of it as a system and\nmodeling its components and how they interact. In some cases it would be useful to study how\nenergy and matter flow through the system, or to study how structure affects function (or\nmalfunction). These preliminary studies may suggest explanations for the phenomena, which could\nbe checked by predicting patterns that might emerge if the explanation is correct, and matching\nthose predictions with those observed in the real world.\nCrosscutting concepts can help students better understand science and engineering practices.\nBecause the crosscutting concepts address the fundamental aspects of nature, they also inform the\nway humans attempt to understand it. Different crosscutting concepts align with different practices,\nand when students carry out these practices, they are often addressing one of these crosscutting\nconcepts. For example, when students analyze and interpret data, they are often looking for patterns\nin observations, mathematical or visual. The practice of planning and carrying out an investigation\nis often aimed at identifying cause and effect relationships: if you poke or prod something, what\nwill happen? The crosscutting concept of “Systems and System Models” is clearly related to the\npractice of developing and using models.\nRepetition in different contexts will be necessary to build familiarity. Repetition is counter to\nthe guiding principles the writing team used in creating performance expectations to reflect the core\nideas in the science disciplines. In order to reduce the total amount of material students are held\naccountable to learn, repetition was reduced whenever possible. However, crosscutting concepts are\nrepeated within grades at the elementary level and grade-bands at the middle and high school levels\nso these concepts “become common and familiar touchstones across the disciplines and grade\nlevels.” (p. 83)\nCrosscutting concepts should grow in complexity and sophistication across the grades.\nRepetition alone is not sufficient. As students grow in their understanding of the science disciplines,\ndepth of understanding crosscutting concepts should grow as well. The writing team has adapted\nand added to the ideas expressed in the Framework in developing a matrix for use in crafting\nperformance expectations that describe student understanding of the crosscutting concepts. The\nmatrix is found at the end of this section.\nApril 2013 NGSS Release Page 3 of 17\nCrosscutting concepts can provide a common vocabulary for science and engineering. The\npractices, disciplinary core ideas, and crosscutting concepts are the same in science and\nengineering. What is different is how and why they are used—to explain natural phenomena in\nscience, and to solve a problem or accomplish a goal in engineering. Students need both types of\nexperiences to develop a deep and flexible understanding of how these terms are applied in each of\nthese closely allied fields. As crosscutting concepts are encountered repeatedly across academic\ndisciplines, familiar vocabulary can enhance engagement and understanding for English language\nlearners, students with language processing difficulties, and students with limited literacy\ndevelopment.\nCrosscutting concepts should not be assessed separately from practices or core ideas. Students\nshould not be assessed on their ability to define “pattern,” “system,” or any other crosscutting\nconcepts as a separate vocabulary word. To capture the vision in the Framework, students should be\nassessed on the extent to which they have achieved a coherent scientific worldview by recognizing\nsimilarities among core ideas in science or engineering that may at first seem very different, but are\nunited through crosscutting concepts.\nPerformance expectations focus on some but not all capabilities associated with a crosscutting\nconcept. As core ideas grow in complexity and sophistication across the grades it becomes more\nand more difficult to express them fully in performance expectations. Consequently, most\nperformance expectations reflect only some aspects of a crosscutting concept. These aspects are\nindicated in the right-hand foundation box in each of the standards. All aspects of each core idea\nconsidered by the writing team can be found in the matrix at the end of this section.\nCrosscutting concepts are for all students. Crosscutting concepts raise the bar for students who\nhave not achieved at high levels in academic subjects and often assigned to classes that emphasize\n“the basics,” which in science may be taken to provide primarily factual information and lower\u0002order thinking skills. Consequently, it is essential that all students engage in using crosscutting\nconcepts, which could result in leveling the playing field and promoting deeper understanding for\nall students.\nInclusion of Nature of Science and Engineering Concepts. Sometimes included in the\ncrosscutting concept foundation boxes are concepts related to materials from the “Nature of\nScience” or “Science, Technology, Society, and the Environment.” These are not to be confused\nwith the “Crosscutting Concepts”",

Hence the purpose of highlighting\nthem as Dimension 2 of the framework is to elevate their role in the development of standards,\ncurricula, instruction, and assessments.” (p. 83) The writing team has continued this commitment by\nweaving crosscutting concepts into the performance expectations for all students—so they cannot\nbe left out.\nGuiding Principles\nThe Framework recommended crosscutting concepts be embedded in the science curriculum\nbeginning in the earliest years of schooling and suggested a number of guiding principles for how\nthey should be used. The development process of the standards provided insights into the\ncrosscutting concepts. These insights are shared in the following guiding principles.\nCrosscutting concepts can help students better understand core ideas in science and\nengineering. When students encounter new phenomena, whether in a science lab, field trip, or on\ntheir own, they need mental tools to help engage in and come to understand the phenomena from a\nscientific point of view. Familiarity with crosscutting concepts can provide that perspective. For\nexample, when approaching a complex phenomenon (either a natural phenomenon or a machine) an\napproach that makes sense is to begin by observing and characterizing the phenomenon in terms of\npatterns. A next step might be to simplify the phenomenon by thinking of it as a system and\nmodeling its components and how they interact. In some cases it would be useful to study how\nenergy and matter flow through the system, or to study how structure affects function (or\nmalfunction). These preliminary studies may suggest explanations for the phenomena, which could\nbe checked by predicting patterns that might emerge if the explanation is correct, and matching\nthose predictions with those observed in the real world.\nCrosscutting concepts can help students better understand science and engineering practices.\nBecause the crosscutting concepts address the fundamental aspects of nature, they also inform the\nway humans attempt to understand it. Different crosscutting concepts align with different practices,\nand when students carry out these practices, they are often addressing one of these crosscutting\nconcepts. For example, when students analyze and interpret data, they are often looking for patterns\nin observations, mathematical or visual. The practice of planning and carrying out an investigation\nis often aimed at identifying cause and effect relationships: if you poke or prod something, what\nwill happen? The crosscutting concept of “Systems and System Models” is clearly related to the\npractice of developing and using models.\nRepetition in different contexts will be necessary to build familiarity. Repetition is counter to\nthe guiding principles the writing team used in creating performance expectations to reflect the core\nideas in the science disciplines. In order to reduce the total amount of material students are held\naccountable to learn, repetition was reduced whenever possible. However, crosscutting concepts are\nrepeated within grades at the elementary level and grade-bands at the middle and high school levels\nso these concepts “become common and familiar touchstones across the disciplines and grade\nlevels.” (p. 83)\nCrosscutting concepts should grow in complexity and sophistication across the grades.\nRepetition alone is not sufficient. As students grow in their understanding of the science disciplines,\ndepth of understanding crosscutting concepts should grow as well. The writing team has adapted\nand added to the ideas expressed in the Framework in developing a matrix for use in crafting\nperformance expectations that describe student understanding of the crosscutting concepts. The\nmatrix is found at the end of this section.\nApril 2013 NGSS Release Page 3 of 17\nCrosscutting concepts can provide a common vocabulary for science and engineering. The\npractices, disciplinary core ideas, and crosscutting concepts are the same in science and\nengineering. What is different is how and why they are used—to explain natural phenomena in\nscience, and to solve a problem or accomplish a goal in engineering. Students need both types of\nexperiences to develop a deep and flexible understanding of how these terms are applied in each of\nthese closely allied fields. As crosscutting concepts are encountered repeatedly across academic\ndisciplines, familiar vocabulary can enhance engagement and understanding for English language\nlearners, students with language processing difficulties, and students with limited literacy\ndevelopment.\nCrosscutting concepts should not be assessed separately from practices or core ideas. Students\nshould not be assessed on their ability to define “pattern,” “system,” or any other crosscutting\nconcepts as a separate vocabulary word. To capture the vision in the Framework, students should be\nassessed on the extent to which they have achieved a coherent scientific worldview by recognizing\nsimilarities among core ideas in science or engineering that may at first seem very different, but are\nunited through crosscutting concepts.\nPerformance expectations focus on some but not all capabilities associated with a crosscutting\nconcept. As core ideas grow in complexity and sophistication across the grades it becomes more\nand more difficult to express them fully in performance expectations. Consequently, most\nperformance expectations reflect only some aspects of a crosscutting concept. These aspects are\nindicated in the right-hand foundation box in each of the standards. All aspects of each core idea\nconsidered by the writing team can be found in the matrix at the end of this section.\nCrosscutting concepts are for all students. Crosscutting concepts raise the bar for students who\nhave not achieved at high levels in academic subjects and often assigned to classes that emphasize\n“the basics,” which in science may be taken to provide primarily factual information and lower\u0002order thinking skills. Consequently, it is essential that all students engage in using crosscutting\nconcepts, which could result in leveling the playing field and promoting deeper understanding for\nall students.\nInclusion of Nature of Science and Engineering Concepts. Sometimes included in the\ncrosscutting concept foundation boxes are concepts related to materials from the “Nature of\nScience” or “Science, Technology, Society, and the Environment.” These are not to be confused\nwith the “Crosscutting Concepts”",

Wittgenstein, Bemerkungen tiber die Grundlagen de Mathematik\n(1956)\nTwo themes, in counterpoint, are the motif of this book. The first one is\nthe autonomy exhibited by systems in nature . The second one is their\ncognitive, informational abilities.\nThese two themes stand in relation to one another as the inside and\nthe outside of a circle drawn in a plane, inseparably distinct, yet bridged\nby the hand that draws them.\nAutonomy means, literally, self-law. To see what this entails, it is\neasier to contrast it with its mirror image, allonomy or external law. This\nis, of course , what we call control. These two images, autonomy and\nxii Preface\ncontrol , do a continuous dance. One represents generation, internal reg\u0002ulation, assertion of one's own identity: definition from the inside. The\nother one represents consumption, input and output, assertion of the\nidentity of other: definition from outside . Their interplay spans a broad\nrange , from genetics to psychotherapy.\nWe all know control well; it has been charted out and formalized.\nHence the power of the computer and of consumer-oriented services. Its\npopular model is: something in/process/something out. We stand on both\nsides of in and out, whether an economic system, a compiler, or a\nperson's mind. The fundamental paradigm of our interaction with a con\u0002trol system is instruction, and the unsatisfactory results are errors.\nAutonomy has been less fashionable. It is usually taken as a more\nvague and somewhat moralistic term, and waved off as a question of\nindeterminancy. There is little u nderstanding of its generic import , let\nalone i ts representation in formal terms. The fundamental paradigm of\nour interaction with an autonomous system is a conversation, and its\nunsatisfactory results breaches of understanding.\nOne fundamental intention of this book is to bring the interplay of\nthese two notions into the open, and to identify the underlying mecha\u0002nisms that endow natural systems with autonomy. As it turns out, these\nmechanisms have to do with the pervasive circularities to be found in\nnature . We are led to consider in all seriousness the traditional image of\nthe snake eating its own tail as the guiding image for autonomy as self\u0002law and self-regulation. But what does this \" self\" mean, more precisely?\nA focus on this question is a guiding thread throughout this book, leading\nus to a characterization of self-referential, recursive processes and their\nproperties as fundamental mechanisms of natural autonomy.\nThe way a system is identified and specified through our interactions\nwith it is not separable from the way its cognitive performance is under\u0002stood. The control characterization is intimately tied up with an under\u0002standing of information1 as instruction and representation. Accordingly,\nto explore the way in which a systems specifies its own identity is also\nto explore what its informational actions can possibly mean (Piaget,\n1 1 969). Thus, by discussing autonomy, we are led to a reexamination of\nlthe notion of information itself: away from instruction, to the way in\n'which information is constructed; away from representation, to the way\n:in which adequate behavior reflects viability in the system's functioning\nrather than a correspondence with a given state of affairs.\nIt can be said that the central line of thinking in this book is to untie,\nexplicitly, the knots of this inseparable trio: a system's identity , its per\u00021 I use here the word information in its most generic sense of semeios.

Creation involves the processes that use knowledge to transform matter and energy. The system with “self” awareness is assembled using physical structures with several constituent components. Safekeeping involves the ability to dynamically monitor and control an organism’s behavior along with its interactions with its environment using genetic descriptions. Intelligent systems augment inherited knowledge through genes with cognitive processes embedded in the nervous systems and neural networks.

Autopoiesis refers to the behavior of a system that replicates itself and maintains identity and stability while its components face fluctuations caused by external influences. Autopoiesis enables them to use the specification in their genomes to instantiate themselves using matter and energy transformations. They reproduce, replicate, and manage their stability using cognitive processes. Cognition allows them to process information into knowledge and use it to manage its interactions between various constituent parts within the system and its interaction with the environment. Cognition uses various mechanisms to gather information from various sources, convert it into knowledge, develop a history through memorizing the transactions, and identify new associations through their analysis.

        "text": "<div><section><div><div><p>Context: In this paper I expand aspects of the generalized bottom-up explanatory approach devised in Part I to expound the natural emergence of composite self-organized dynamic systems endowed with self-produced embodied boundaries and with observed degrees of autonomous behavior. In Part I, the focus was on the rules defined by Varela, Maturana &amp; Uribe (VM&amp;U rules), viewed as a validation test to assess if an observed system is autopoietic. This was accomplished by referring to Maturana's ontological-epistemological frame and by defining distinctions, concepts, and abstractions necessary to describe dynamic systems in any observational domain. This approach concentrates on pure causation flow rather than on domain-specific interaction mechanisms. Problem: It is essential to analyze the requirements imposed by the VM&amp;U rules on the \"intra-boundaries\" phenomenology for compliance with the self-production capabilities expected from an autopoietic system. Beyond what is merely implied by the compact wording of the VM&amp;U rules, a key point needs to be addressed explicitly: how to describe some \"peculiar\" capabilities that the components should be endowed with to participate in new component production (as macro-molecules do in the biological domain) so that system's self-production can be assessed. Method: Using this approach, I first describe the process of constituting self-organized dynamic structures provided with embodied boundaries. Then I explain how a capability of self-organization emerges and how this results in ephemeral configurations that may evolve into self-regulated long-lasting dynamic system stability within a continuous causation flow inside the boundaries, up to the emergence of some \"specialized\" subsets of components. This explication allows us to distinguish the medium, the boundaries, and the core of a self-organized dynamic system and to focus attention on the \"intra-boundaries\" phenomenology that should be at the heart of self-production capabilities, as prescribed by the 5th and 6th VM&amp;U rules. Results: I propose an abstract, domain-free description of the \"peculiar\" composition and decomposition transformation capabilities that components should possess while subject to state transitions triggered within the \"intraboundaries\" causation flow. This is combined with a discussion concerning the \"intra- boundaries\" causation structure's possible topological layouts that could be compliant with the 6th rule. Implications: The above-mentioned results allow us to improve our analytic criteria when observing dynamic systems existing in non-biological domains in order to assess their autopoietic nature. They also reveal that the task of consistently identifying possible non-biological autopoietic systems is harder than merely identifying self-organized dynamic systems provided with boundaries and some observable autonomous behavioral capabilities in a given observational domain. More implications will be discussed further in Part III.</p><div><div><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Example-of-a-linear-path-of-oriented-relations-The-subset-of-nodes-A-B-C-D-E-is-a_fig1_291815785\"><div></div></a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Example-of-a-linear-path-of-oriented-relations-The-subset-of-nodes-A-B-C-D-E-is-a_fig1_291815785\"><div><p>Example of a linear path of oriented relations: The subset of nodes {A, B, C, D, E} is a structure of nodes linked by a linear path, i.e., the subset of oriented relations {R {A, B}, R {B, C}, R {C, D}, R {D, E}} (represented by the bold arrows).

        "html": "<div><section><div><div><p>Context: In this paper I expand aspects of the generalized bottom-up explanatory approach devised in Part I to expound the natural emergence of composite self-organized dynamic systems endowed with self-produced embodied boundaries and with observed degrees of autonomous behavior. In Part I, the focus was on the rules defined by Varela, Maturana &amp; Uribe (VM&amp;U rules), viewed as a validation test to assess if an observed system is autopoietic. This was accomplished by referring to Maturana's ontological-epistemological frame and by defining distinctions, concepts, and abstractions necessary to describe dynamic systems in any observational domain. This approach concentrates on pure causation flow rather than on domain-specific interaction mechanisms. Problem: It is essential to analyze the requirements imposed by the VM&amp;U rules on the \"intra-boundaries\" phenomenology for compliance with the self-production capabilities expected from an autopoietic system. Beyond what is merely implied by the compact wording of the VM&amp;U rules, a key point needs to be addressed explicitly: how to describe some \"peculiar\" capabilities that the components should be endowed with to participate in new component production (as macro-molecules do in the biological domain) so that system's self-production can be assessed. Method: Using this approach, I first describe the process of constituting self-organized dynamic structures provided with embodied boundaries. Then I explain how a capability of self-organization emerges and how this results in ephemeral configurations that may evolve into self-regulated long-lasting dynamic system stability within a continuous causation flow inside the boundaries, up to the emergence of some \"specialized\" subsets of components. This explication allows us to distinguish the medium, the boundaries, and the core of a self-organized dynamic system and to focus attention on the \"intra-boundaries\" phenomenology that should be at the heart of self-production capabilities, as prescribed by the 5th and 6th VM&amp;U rules. Results: I propose an abstract, domain-free description of the \"peculiar\" composition and decomposition transformation capabilities that components should possess while subject to state transitions triggered within the \"intraboundaries\" causation flow. This is combined with a discussion concerning the \"intra- boundaries\" causation structure's possible topological layouts that could be compliant with the 6th rule. Implications: The above-mentioned results allow us to improve our analytic criteria when observing dynamic systems existing in non-biological domains in order to assess their autopoietic nature. They also reveal that the task of consistently identifying possible non-biological autopoietic systems is harder than merely identifying self-organized dynamic systems provided with boundaries and some observable autonomous behavioral capabilities in a given observational domain. More implications will be discussed further in Part III.</p><div><div><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Example-of-a-linear-path-of-oriented-relations-The-subset-of-nodes-A-B-C-D-E-is-a_fig1_291815785\"><div></div></a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Example-of-a-linear-path-of-oriented-relations-The-subset-of-nodes-A-B-C-D-E-is-a_fig1_291815785\"><div><p>Example of a linear path of oriented relations: The subset of nodes {A, B, C, D, E} is a structure of nodes linked by a linear path, i.e., the subset of oriented relations {R {A, B}, R {B, C}, R {C, D}, R {D, E}} (represented by the bold arrows).

Increasing material means, growing scientific knowledge, and enhanced technological capability no doubt contribute to this re-creative potential. Yet, the developmental path that a society ultimately treads is, arguably, not predetermined and is conditioned on a number of decisions made at various levels. Those decisions are perhaps in no small part influenced by what people consider to be knowledge, whether about themselves, or about the world in which they find themselves. It would appear important to consider therefore, in both principle and practice, the ways in which humanity generates, disseminates, and applies knowledge.</p><p>* * *</p><p>What people consider to be knowledge spans a variety of domains. This can include so-called physical phenomena such as the motion of the planets or the functioning of the human body as well as what might be termed social phenomena, such as human happiness, institutional development, and business management. Undoubtedly, both categories of knowledge have practical consequences for the organization and ultimate success or failure, however that might be defined, of a civilization.</p><p>Underlying most conceptualizations of knowledge is the ontological commitment to the object-subject dichotomy, that is, the identification of the observer as interacting with a thing separate from itself that is observed. The figure below visually depicts the relationship that would exist between the language people use to describe behaviors that presumably exist independently in the world.</p><div><figure><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24a454dc-788c-48f6-b964-c7d3d1b04aeb_935x103.png\"><div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Figure 1. Simplified diagram of knowledge acquisition through a subject-object lens</em></p><p>This mode of thinking—complemented, of course, by a wide array of interrelated concepts and practices—has yielded many of the scientific, institutional, social, and material fruits from which humanity has benefitted over the past two centuries. Despite this, a growing chorus of voices have explored various conceptual and pragmatic problems arising from this subject-object orientation, such as a rise in fundamentalism, orthodoxy, relativism, and nihilism as well as the false positive-normative dichotomy, or the problem of the double-hermeneutic (i.e. in which the object becomes the subject).</p><p>In the late 1900s, two Chilean biologists, Maturana and Varela, elaborated a conceptualization of a living organism that may help expand the notion of knowledge and address some of the issues noted above.

It is required during both consolidation and reconsolidation, the posttraining and postreactivation phases that change the state of the memory from a fragile into a stable and long-lasting form. Transcription generates both mRNAs that are translated into proteins, which are necessary for the growth of new synaptic connections, as well as noncoding RNA transcripts that have regulatory or effector roles in gene expression. The result is a cascade of events that ultimately leads to structural changes in the neurons that mediate long-term memory storage. The de novo transcription, critical for synaptic plasticity and memory formation, is orchestrated by chromatin and epigenetic modifications. The complexity of transcription regulation, its temporal progression, and the effectors produced all contribute to the flexibility and persistence of long-term memory formation.

Without the ability to store information about our experiences for the long term, our lives would be a series of disconnected fragments. Memories shape our character and, thus, contribute to every aspect of our individuality. The process of long-term memory formation is complex and is accompanied by long-lasting structural modification in the brain.</p>\n<p>Long-term memories do not form immediately after learning but develop with time. They are initially fragile, but through a process of stabilization, known as memory consolidation, they become resistant to disruption (<a href=\"#A021741C11\">Bailey et al. 1996</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C78\">McGaugh 2000</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C31\">Dudai 2012</a>). The biological mechanisms underlying consolidation start with a rapid phase of de novo gene expression, known as cellular or molecular consolidation. This begins at the onset of training and is a fundamental signature of long-term memory formation found in numerous species and in both explicit and implicit types of memories. Consolidation is manifest not only in behavior, but also in the cellular and molecular mechanisms contributing to long-term synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#A021741C58\">Kandel 2001</a>, <a href=\"#A021741C60\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C6\">Alberini 2009</a>). Although it was long believed that molecular consolidation is completed rapidly, within a few hours, it recently emerged that in vivo it continues for at least 24 h, a temporal window in which circadian rhythms and sleep may make an important contribution (<a href=\"#A021741C32\">Eckel-Mahan and Storm 2009</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C120\">Wang et al. 2011</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C117\">Tononi and Cirelli 2014</a>).</p>\n<p>For example, in the hippocampus, a brain region critical for the formation of long-term contextual, spatial, and episodic memories, the gene expression–dependent phase necessary for the consolidation of inhibitory avoidance memory in rats lasts for more than 24 h, and seems to be completed by 48 h after training (<a href=\"#A021741C114\">Taubenfeld et al. 2001b</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C6\">Alberini 2009</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C15\">Bekinschtein et al. 2014</a>). In addition, through a subsequent process called system consolidation, the initial critical role of the hippocampus continues for up to weeks in mice and even up to years in humans, although, over time, it can become dispensable (<a href=\"#A021741C109\">Squire et al. 2004</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C123\">Wiltgen and Tanaka 2013</a>). As a result, memory loss can still occur weeks after training in animals, and even years in humans, when the hippocampus is either inactivated or ablated. At the end of this phase of system consolidation, memories become insensitive to disruption by either pharmacological or molecular manipulations or hippocampal disruption/inactivation, and are therefore considered consolidated at the system level. System consolidation is primarily found in hippocampus-based explicit memories. Implicit memories, such as emotional Pavlovian associations that require the amygdala (e.g., cued fear conditioning) undergo molecular consolidation, but they are not known to undergo system consolidation like the hippocampal-dependent ones. However, it is important to keep in mind that, although the distinction between implicit and explicit memory can be seen and studied in laboratory settings in which conditions can be controlled, different implicit and explicit memory processes generally interact to form long-term memories in real life (<a href=\"#A021741C94\">Phelps 2004</a>).</p>\n<p>It was long believed that the molecular/cellular phase of memory consolidation occurs only once, following training. Recently, however, we have learned that when memories that have become resistant to molecular interferences, hence, consolidated with respect to the molecular consolidation process are reactivated by a retrieval event, they can, as a result, become temporarily sensitive to disruption. During the first few hours after reactivation, de novo transcription and translation are required as is the case during consolidation. Only over time do the memories regain their stability and resilience. Because of the similarities with consolidation, this postreactivation process of stabilization is known as memory reconsolidation (<a href=\"#A021741C105\">Sara 2000</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C6\">Alberini 2011</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C84\">Nader and Einarsson 2010</a>). The reconsolidation of different types of memories shows different temporal boundaries. Although hippocampal-based memories undergo a temporal gradient of stabilization for postretrieval interference and seem to become at one point resilient (<a href=\"#A021741C81\">Milekic and Alberini 2002</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C111\">Suzuki et al. 2004</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C35\">Frankland et al. 2006</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C41\">Graff et al. 2014</a>), amygdala-based memories can reconsolidate for a long time after training (<a href=\"#A021741C28\">Debiec et al. 2002</a>, <a href=\"#A021741C29\">2006</a>). The reasons for this difference may very well reside in the different processing and mechanisms of the distinct memory systems. It is thought that hippocampal–cortical system consolidation may explain the temporal window during which these memories can undergo reconsolidation (<a href=\"#A021741C7\">Alberini 2011</a>).</p>\n<p>A fundamental biological mechanism for both consolidation and reconsolidation is de novo gene expression, and both processes recruit several overlapping mechanisms, including transcription factors and regulators. Thus, important questions to be understood are: How can DNA transcription promote memory stabilization? Are these changes in gene expression transient or do they last for weeks, months, or even years paralleling memory storage? This central issue has attracted the attention of many neuroscientists in the last two decades and has been investigated in in vitro models and a variety of behavioral paradigms in invertebrates as well as in mammals. These studies have asked: What regulatory mechanisms of transcription are involved in long-term memory formation? Can these changes in gene expression by themselves explain the long persistence of memories? What are the genes transcribed in response to the experience and what are their functions? Are these molecular mechanisms important therapeutic targets for treating memory disorders?</p>\n<p>In this review, we summarize some of the current answers to these questions. Given the large number of studies, we will only be able to describe examples of (1) the major classes of transcription factors that play a critical role in both posttraining and postretrieval transcriptional regulation; (2) the target sequences regulated, including effector genes; and (3) the noncoding RNAs that have recently been found to regulate transcription and that can lead to chromatin, DNA, and RNA modifications that act in concert with transcription factors to regulate transcription important for memory consolidation.</p>\n<section><h2>MEMORY CONSOLIDATION AND RECONSOLIDATION REQUIRE TRANSCRIPTION</h2>\n<p>Transcription, the first step of gene expression, is the mechanism that copies a sequence of DNA into RNAs. It is a complex process that requires the concerted action of protein and RNA complexes that together dictate the expression of target genes. It is estimated that 5%–10% of the expressed sequences in the human genome encode for transcription regulators, which indicates the importance and complexity of regulating transcription. Transcription regulators include DNA-binding proteins that dictate the rate of gene transcription and are commonly known as transcription factors, cofactors that interact with transcription factors, chromatin regulators, the general transcription machinery, and their regulators. The complexity of transcription regulation implies the versatility, selectivity, and flexibility of the process, which, in fact, governs all cellular functions.</p>\n<p>Studies using inhibitors of mRNA transcription in a variety of species ranging from invertebrates to mammals have shown that memory consolidation requires the synthesis of mRNAs and their translation into proteins, and that these transcriptional events are a fundamental and evolutionarily conserved mechanism of long-term memory formation ",

Although it was long believed that molecular consolidation is completed rapidly, within a few hours, it recently emerged that in vivo it continues for at least 24 h, a temporal window in which circadian rhythms and sleep may make an important contribution (<a href=\"#A021741C32\">Eckel-Mahan and Storm 2009</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C120\">Wang et al. 2011</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C117\">Tononi and Cirelli 2014</a>).</p>\n<p>For example, in the hippocampus, a brain region critical for the formation of long-term contextual, spatial, and episodic memories, the gene expression–dependent phase necessary for the consolidation of inhibitory avoidance memory in rats lasts for more than 24 h, and seems to be completed by 48 h after training (<a href=\"#A021741C114\">Taubenfeld et al. 2001b</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C6\">Alberini 2009</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C15\">Bekinschtein et al. 2014</a>). In addition, through a subsequent process called system consolidation, the initial critical role of the hippocampus continues for up to weeks in mice and even up to years in humans, although, over time, it can become dispensable (<a href=\"#A021741C109\">Squire et al. 2004</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C123\">Wiltgen and Tanaka 2013</a>). As a result, memory loss can still occur weeks after training in animals, and even years in humans, when the hippocampus is either inactivated or ablated. At the end of this phase of system consolidation, memories become insensitive to disruption by either pharmacological or molecular manipulations or hippocampal disruption/inactivation, and are therefore considered consolidated at the system level. System consolidation is primarily found in hippocampus-based explicit memories. Implicit memories, such as emotional Pavlovian associations that require the amygdala (e.g., cued fear conditioning) undergo molecular consolidation, but they are not known to undergo system consolidation like the hippocampal-dependent ones. However, it is important to keep in mind that, although the distinction between implicit and explicit memory can be seen and studied in laboratory settings in which conditions can be controlled, different implicit and explicit memory processes generally interact to form long-term memories in real life (<a href=\"#A021741C94\">Phelps 2004</a>).</p>\n<p>It was long believed that the molecular/cellular phase of memory consolidation occurs only once, following training. Recently, however, we have learned that when memories that have become resistant to molecular interferences, hence, consolidated with respect to the molecular consolidation process are reactivated by a retrieval event, they can, as a result, become temporarily sensitive to disruption. During the first few hours after reactivation, de novo transcription and translation are required as is the case during consolidation. Only over time do the memories regain their stability and resilience. Because of the similarities with consolidation, this postreactivation process of stabilization is known as memory reconsolidation (<a href=\"#A021741C105\">Sara 2000</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C6\">Alberini 2011</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C84\">Nader and Einarsson 2010</a>). The reconsolidation of different types of memories shows different temporal boundaries. Although hippocampal-based memories undergo a temporal gradient of stabilization for postretrieval interference and seem to become at one point resilient (<a href=\"#A021741C81\">Milekic and Alberini 2002</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C111\">Suzuki et al. 2004</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C35\">Frankland et al. 2006</a>; <a href=\"#A021741C41\">Graff et al. 2014</a>), amygdala-based memories can reconsolidate for a long time after training (<a href=\"#A021741C28\">Debiec et al. 2002</a>, <a href=\"#A021741C29\">2006</a>). The reasons for this difference may very well reside in the different processing and mechanisms of the distinct memory systems. It is thought that hippocampal–cortical system consolidation may explain the temporal window during which these memories can undergo reconsolidation (<a href=\"#A021741C7\">Alberini 2011</a>).</p>\n<p>A fundamental biological mechanism for both consolidation and reconsolidation is de novo gene expression, and both processes recruit several overlapping mechanisms, including transcription factors and regulators. Thus, important questions to be understood are: How can DNA transcription promote memory stabilization? Are these changes in gene expression transient or do they last for weeks, months, or even years paralleling memory storage? This central issue has attracted the attention of many neuroscientists in the last two decades and has been investigated in in vitro models and a variety of behavioral paradigms in invertebrates as well as in mammals. These studies have asked: What regulatory mechanisms of transcription are involved in long-term memory formation? Can these changes in gene expression by themselves explain the long persistence of memories? What are the genes transcribed in response to the experience and what are their functions? Are these molecular mechanisms important therapeutic targets for treating memory disorders?</p>\n<p>In this review, we summarize some of the current answers to these questions. Given the large number of studies, we will only be able to describe examples of (1) the major classes of transcription factors that play a critical role in both posttraining and postretrieval transcriptional regulation; (2) the target sequences regulated, including effector genes; and (3) the noncoding RNAs that have recently been found to regulate transcription and that can lead to chromatin, DNA, and RNA modifications that act in concert with transcription factors to regulate transcription important for memory consolidation.</p>\n<section><h2>MEMORY CONSOLIDATION AND RECONSOLIDATION REQUIRE TRANSCRIPTION</h2>\n<p>Transcription, the first step of gene expression, is the mechanism that copies a sequence of DNA into RNAs. It is a complex process that requires the concerted action of protein and RNA complexes that together dictate the expression of target genes. It is estimated that 5%–10% of the expressed sequences in the human genome encode for transcription regulators, which indicates the importance and complexity of regulating transcription. Transcription regulators include DNA-binding proteins that dictate the rate of gene transcription and are commonly known as transcription factors, cofactors that interact with transcription factors, chromatin regulators, the general transcription machinery, and their regulators. The complexity of transcription regulation implies the versatility, selectivity, and flexibility of the process, which, in fact, governs all cellular functions.</p>\n<p>Studies using inhibitors of mRNA transcription in a variety of species ranging from invertebrates to mammals have shown that memory consolidation requires the synthesis of mRNAs and their translation into proteins, and that these transcriptional events are a fundamental and evolutionarily conserved mechanism of long-term memory formation ",

Introduction</h2>\n<p>The dominant paradigm in evolutionary biology, sometimes labeled ‘standard’, ‘traditional’, ‘Neo-Darwinian’, or most frequently, ‘Modern Synthesis’ (MS) evolutionary theory, is under severe questioning [<a href=\"#B1-entropy-24-00914\">1</a>,<a href=\"#B2-entropy-24-00914\">2</a>,<a href=\"#B3-entropy-24-00914\">3</a>]. The main points in the discussion have to do with MS’s reductionist character, specifically with its gene-centric approach to biological phenomena such as development, heredity, reproduction, and evolution. Briefly stated, in MS’s view the organism’s development is reduced to the ‘reading’ or expression of a genetic program. Reproduction and inheritance are reduced to mechanisms of DNA copy and transmission. The origin of variation is reduced to the occurrence of genetic mutations, and the evolutionary process itself is reduced to a change in allele frequencies in a population over time. As Walsh critically points out, “Modern Synthesis evolution is a fundamentally molecular phenomenon” ([<a href=\"#B4-entropy-24-00914\">4</a>], p. x).</p>\n<p>In response, critics have called for a rethink of the evolutionary theory, arguing for the elaboration of a new evolutionary synthesis (e.g., [<a href=\"#B5-entropy-24-00914\">5</a>,<a href=\"#B6-entropy-24-00914\">6</a>,<a href=\"#B7-entropy-24-00914\">7</a>]), more holistic and focused on the organism and its constructive interaction with the environment. Several theoretical streams converge in this project, including among others the integrated evolutionary synthesis [<a href=\"#B8-entropy-24-00914\">8</a>,<a href=\"#B9-entropy-24-00914\">9</a>], the extended evolutionary synthesis [<a href=\"#B10-entropy-24-00914\">10</a>,<a href=\"#B11-entropy-24-00914\">11</a>] the situated Darwinism [<a href=\"#B4-entropy-24-00914\">4</a>,<a href=\"#B12-entropy-24-00914\">12</a>], and the fourth perspective on evolution [<a href=\"#B13-entropy-24-00914\">13</a>]. These critical streams come with different emphases and degrees of radicality but share the spirit of building an alternative research program to MS, putting the organisms, not the genes, as the central agents of evolution [<a href=\"#B14-entropy-24-00914\">14</a>]. For the purposes of this paper, the generic expression ‘new evolutionary synthesis’ (NES) will be used to collectively designate all these new trends in contemporary evolutionary biology.</p>\n<p>The NES movement implies reconceptualizing the organisms as agents. However, the precise sense and reach of this reconceptualization are not uniform within the movement [<a href=\"#B13-entropy-24-00914\">13</a>]. Two different versions of NES can be distinguished in this regard. One version, which we call restrictive, sees the organisms as agents in a weak, restricted, and non-teleological sense, without appealing to, or being grounded on, any general theory of living beings in an explicit way. The other, more ambitious one, which we call comprehensive, sees the organisms as agents in a strong, comprehensive, and teleological sense -what they call the agent theory-, appealing as a ground to a thermodynamically inspired theory of living beings that conceives of them as natural purposes.</p>\n<p>In this paper, we argue that in between these two versions of NES there is room for a third and better one, which we identify with the autopoietic approach to life and evolution. This approach contemplates the natural drift theory of evolution (NDT) and the embodied autopoietic theory of living beings (EAT). The rationale behind our argument is as follows. Grounding NES on a thermodynamic theory of living beings, as the comprehensive version does, is positive because it ontologically strengthens the project in front of MS. However, linking such a grounding to teleology, as the comprehensive version also does, is highly problematic because it puts NES in conflict with modern science’s methodological framework. Comparatively, the restrictive NES, lacking an ontological grounding, is a theoretically weaker version than the comprehensive one, but, having no commitment to teleology, fits well with the framework of modern science. In this scenario, we propose the autopoietic combination NDT+EAT as an intermediate way that can integrate the positive points of the two existing versions of NES, avoiding their weaknesses. NDT, as we will show, is an organism-centered evolutionary theory that provides NES with a teleology-free, scientifically respectful ontological grounding in the form of a thermodynamic, embodied autopoietic theory of living beings (EAT).</p>\n<p>It is important to clarify from the start the nature and reach of our argument. Our analysis is theoretical, philosophical, and programmatic. We will not argue that the autopoietic approach, i.e., NDT+EAT, is a better option because it delivers new predictions or greater empirical content relative to the existing versions of NES. We assume, for the sake of the argument, that the autopoietic approach, given its core theoretical assumptions (see <a href=\"#sec3-entropy-24-00914\">Section 3</a>), has at least a similar empirical power to the existing versions of NES. On that common ground, we argue that the combination NDT+EAT, from the programmatic point of view, is a better option because, although it provides NES with an ontological ground, it does it in a more parsimonious, less philosophically demanding way, avoiding methodological conflicts with modern science.</p>\n<p>The structure of the paper is as follows.

In <a href=\"#sec4-entropy-24-00914\">Section 4</a>, we examine how an embodied autopoietic theory of living beings (EAT) can provide a thermodynamic and yet non-teleological ground for NDT, and by extension, for NES.

NES and Its Two Versions: Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>\n<p>NES can be characterized, basically, by contrast with MS. The different way, relative to MS, in which NES understands key concepts such as inheritance, development, evolution, and organism, defines NES’s theoretical identity. (In the next section, we will argue that NDT is a NES representative by appealing to these key concepts). Let us briefly review the core assumptions of NES.</p>\n<section><h3>2.1. NES’s Core Ideas</h3>\n<p><em>Inheritance.</em> A central idea in NES is the emphasis on extended or inclusive inheritance [<a href=\"#B15-entropy-24-00914\">15</a>]. In contrast to MS’s notion of heredity, which is restricted only to genetic inheritance, in NES heredity is defined to include all causal mechanisms by which offspring come to resemble their parents [<a href=\"#B10-entropy-24-00914\">10</a>]. Inheritance extends beyond genes to encompass epigenetic inheritance, physiological inheritance, ecological inheritance, and behavioral-cultural inheritance [<a href=\"#B16-entropy-24-00914\">16</a>,<a href=\"#B17-entropy-24-00914\">17</a>,<a href=\"#B18-entropy-24-00914\">18</a>].</p>\n<p><em>Development.</em> In MS, development is understood as the execution of a program encoded in and inherited through the genes, where the rest of the developing organism operates as a decoding machine. In contrast, in NES phenotypes themselves are not inherited but rather re-constructed in development, and development is understood as a process that depends not only on genetic factors, but also on epigenetic, environmental, behavioral, and cultural [<a href=\"#B10-entropy-24-00914\">10</a>,<a href=\"#B19-entropy-24-00914\">19</a>,<a href=\"#B20-entropy-24-00914\">20</a>,<a href=\"#B21-entropy-24-00914\">21</a>].</p>\n<p><em>Evolution.</em> Unlike MS, in which evolution only requires, and is often reductively defined as, change in gene frequencies in populations [<a href=\"#B22-entropy-24-00914\">22",

NES’s Core Ideas</h3>\n<p><em>Inheritance.</em> A central idea in NES is the emphasis on extended or inclusive inheritance [<a href=\"#B15-entropy-24-00914\">15</a>]. In contrast to MS’s notion of heredity, which is restricted only to genetic inheritance, in NES heredity is defined to include all causal mechanisms by which offspring come to resemble their parents [<a href=\"#B10-entropy-24-00914\">10</a>]. Inheritance extends beyond genes to encompass epigenetic inheritance, physiological inheritance, ecological inheritance, and behavioral-cultural inheritance [<a href=\"#B16-entropy-24-00914\">16</a>,<a href=\"#B17-entropy-24-00914\">17</a>,<a href=\"#B18-entropy-24-00914\">18</a>].</p>\n<p><em>Development.</em> In MS, development is understood as the execution of a program encoded in and inherited through the genes, where the rest of the developing organism operates as a decoding machine. In contrast, in NES phenotypes themselves are not inherited but rather re-constructed in development, and development is understood as a process that depends not only on genetic factors, but also on epigenetic, environmental, behavioral, and cultural [<a href=\"#B10-entropy-24-00914\">10</a>,<a href=\"#B19-entropy-24-00914\">19</a>,<a href=\"#B20-entropy-24-00914\">20</a>,<a href=\"#B21-entropy-24-00914\">21</a>].</p>\n<p><em>Evolution.</em> Unlike MS, in which evolution only requires, and is often reductively defined as, change in gene frequencies in populations [<a href=\"#B22-entropy-24-00914\">22",

One of them states that\nS 2110 Systems, Autopoietic\nan autopoietic system is organized (defined as a unity)\nas a network of processes of production (transforma\u0002tion and destruction) of components that produces the\ncomponents which: (1) through their interactions and\ntransformations regenerate and realize the network of\nprocesses (relations) that produced them; and (2) con\u0002stitute it (the machine) as a concrete unity in the space\nin which they exist by specifying the topological\ndomain of its realization as such a network (Varela\n1979, p. 13). Nearly the same formula was earlier used\nto define an autopoietic machine (Maturana and Varela\n1973/1980, 1984/1987, p. 135).\nCharacteristics\nThe Chilean biologists H. Maturana and F. Varela\nproposed the term autopoiesis in the early 1970s to\naccount for the organization of individual living\nbeings, characterized as a process by which they\nproduce their own identity in a mechanistic way.\nThe autopoietic approach to life is very different\nfrom that of the Theory of Evolution and Molecular\nBiology: On the one hand, instead of reproduction or\nevolution, the theory focuses on autonomy and identity\nto naturalize them as marks of life; on the other hand, it\nconsiders that all system components have the same\nstatus to explain the self-referent dynamics by which\nthey produce a unity; that is to say, living phenome\u0002nology is not explained in terms of some components\nbeing information carriers.\nAutopoietic systems, also called initially\nautopoietic machines, explore the general relational\nscheme common to all living systems as the configu\u0002ration of transformative processes whose result is the\nconfiguration itself, so that identity and activity,\nproducer and product coincide. Unlike Turing\nmachines, set by external programmers (thus being\nheteropoietic) to compute problems referring to issues\nother than the system itself (thus being allopoietic),\nautopoietic machines realize a self-defined identity in\na space of interactions. Already in 1974 (Varela et al.\n1974), the authors presented their account of living\norganization with a computational model in cellular\nautomata which was later rehearsed by Barry\nMcMullin (in Di Paolo 2004).\nSome of these distinctions, for example, between\nautopoietic and heteropoietic, already appear in\nCanguilhem’s La connaisance de la vie. In fact, the\nautopoietic approach belongs to a systemic tradition\nfocused on the problem of the relational unity of the\nliving, associated to Kant’s understanding of organ\u0002isms in the Critique of Judgment, Claude Bernard’s\nconcept of milieu inte´rieur, and the organicist tradition\nthat considers life as organization (G. Canguilhem,\nH. Jonas, J. Piaget among others, see Weber and Varela\n2002), and opposed to the mainstream of the time, such\nas some of the views of Jacob´s La logique du vivant.\nOther clear associations are with the cybernetic\nmovement, especially with second-order cybernetics.\nThe influence of the autopoietic approach has been\nsignificant in theoretical Biology (especially on work\non the definition of life and origins and organization of\nminimal living systems), Artificial Life, and Cognitive\nScience. In contrast, it has had no comparable effect on\nmainstream biology (e.g., Molecular and Evolutionary\nBiology), although it appears to be more present in\nSystems Biology, whose approach is less centered on\nmaster molecules and information.\nThe Main Conceptual Development\nAutopoietic systems aim to grasp what makes an\norganism be a unity of a specific kind, that is to say,\nhow a system appears out of a continuous flux of\ntransformations at the level of its components.\nThe system is characterized by its organizational\nclosure, a notion that provides a reinterpretation of the\ncybernetic notion of circular self-stabilization, which\ninstead of considering single regulatory processes in\nisolation and then coupling them together (as homeo\u0002static machines, acting on internal variables, behave)\nrefers to the whole living system: The autopoietic\nsystem is organized in such a way that it does not\nonly maintain the interval of stability of some\nvariables, but also the global organization is kept\ninvariant.\nSome of the main concepts of the theory refer to\ndistinctions, such as the following:\n• Organization and structure: This emphasizes that an\norganism is not characterized by its material or\nphysicochemical processes, but by how the interac\u0002tions are related to produce and maintain the\nintegrated biological unity they belong to.\nThe structure refers to the variant aspect of a living\nsystem: to its physical realization, whereas the notion\nof organization aims to grasp the invariant one: the\ntopology of the relations that constitute it. Thus, the\nauthors embrace a particular form of multiple\nSystems, Autopoietic 2111 S\nS\nrealizability between organization and structure, as\nthe autopoietic organization is proposed as\na main invariant underlying the diverse biological\nphenomenology, that is conserved through the onto\u0002genetic and phylogenetic changes.\n• Openness and closure: Whereas living systems are\nopen to the exchange of matter and energy at the\nlevel of structure, the network of processes that\nconstitutes their organization is closed in the form\nof a global cyclical process that determines and\nregenerates itself. Rosen developed a similar view\nindependently and expressed it mathematically in\nthe notions of the system being open to material\ncausation and closed to efficient causation (Letelier\net al. 2006).

Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying mutational accumulation is crucial to illuminate the processes that shape tumour evolution<sup><a href=\"#CR1\">1</a></sup>. DNA replication during each cell cycle is an essential biological process that involves the duplication of the entire genome faithfully<sup><a href=\"#CR2\">2</a></sup>. To ensure efficient and accurate replication, and to limit the potential for acquisition of somatic alterations, each chromosome is divided into segments that are replicated in a defined and highly organised temporal order, termed the replication timing (RT) programme<sup><a href=\"#CR2\">2</a>,<a href=\"#CR3\">3</a></sup>. In non-malignant cells, the RT programme is highly conserved across 50%–70% of the genome, while the remaining 30%–50% can dynamically vary during normal development, contributing to tissue-specificity<sup><a href=\"#CR3\">3</a></sup>. Changes to the RT programme during normal lineage differentiation are associated with differences in the transcription level of genes<sup><a href=\"#CR4\">4</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>The RT programme has been linked to the non-uniform acquisition of somatic mutations across the genome during cancer development<sup><a href=\"#CR5\">5</a></sup>. Multiple studies have shown that late replicated regions, which often coincide with condensed chromatin regions, accumulate more mutations including both single nucleotide variants (SNVs)<sup><a href=\"#CR6\">6</a>–<a href=\"#CR8\">8</a></sup> and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs)<sup><a href=\"#CR9\">9</a>–<a href=\"#CR11\">11</a></sup>, compared to regions replicated early during S phase which often are actively transcribed and exhibit open chromatin<sup><a href=\"#CR6\">6</a>,<a href=\"#CR12\">12</a></sup>. Linked to this, prior work has revealed that the patterns of mutational signatures observed across the genome are strongly associated with the RT programme<sup><a href=\"#CR13\">13</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>However, despite the association between the RT programme and the overall genetic alterations in cancer, few studies have focused on how the plasticity and changes to the RT programme interact with the genomic landscape in cancer and thus contribute to cancer development<sup><a href=\"#CR4\">4</a>,<a href=\"#CR14\">14</a>–<a href=\"#CR16\">16</a></sup>. Changes to the RT programme between acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells were reported to be much smaller than those between leukaemia cells and matched normal lymphocytes, suggesting dramatic alterations to RT in cancer compared to normal cells<sup><a href=\"#CR14\">14</a>,<a href=\"#CR15\">15</a></sup>. Similar results were reported in prostate adenocarcinoma compared to matched prostate epithelial cells, with RT changes coinciding with specific types of translocations in cancer<sup><a href=\"#CR16\">16</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>The potential mechanisms responsible for the association between late RT and increased genetic alterations remain unclear. Given the link between chromatin configuration and RT<sup><a href=\"#CR3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#CR17\">17</a>–<a href=\"#CR19\">19</a></sup>, the elevated mutation rate in late replicated regions could primarily reflect a condensed chromatin structure and low DNA repair activity<sup><a href=\"#CR20\">20</a></sup>. However, an in-depth evaluation of the relative impact of changes in chromatin structure versus alterations in RT during cancer development is lacking. Further, the extent to which alterations to the RT programme are associated with the activity of mutational processes remains unclear.</p>\n<p>Here, we set out to explore the extent to which replication timing changes during malignant transformation and its correlation with mutation acquisition, gene expression and chromatin structure during cancer evolution.</p></section><section><h2>Results</h2>\n<section><h3>A resource to evaluate replication timing in lung and breast cancer</h3>\n<p>To evaluate the dynamics of mutation acquisition during cancer evolution, we first explored the density of mutations across the genome by analysing 952 cancer genomes derived from the 100,000 Genomes Project<sup><a href=\"#CR21\">21</a></sup> and Nik-Zainal et al.<sup><a href=\"#CR22\">22</a></sup>. This cohort consists of 470 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and 482 breast carcinoma (BRCA) tumours, containing 152 triple negative breast carcinomas (TNBC), 266 HER2-negative (HER2-), 22 HER2-positive (HER2+) and 42 other breast carcinomas (“Methods” section).</p>\n<p>Comparing the mutation density in genomic regions harbouring different types of somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) revealed a significantly elevated mutation rate in genomic regions subject to copy number (CN) gains relative to ploidy compared to those without (Fig. <a href=\"#Fig1\">1A, B</a>). This suggests that previous studies examining the density of mutations across the genome may be confounded by ignoring the impact of SCNAs on mutation acquisition. To exclude this potential bias, we, therefore, adjusted the local mutation burden (<em>i.e</em>., the mutational burden in a given region of the genome) by the estimated number of alleles harbouring each mutation relative to the total copy number at that position (Fig. <a href=\"#Fig1\">1C</a>). The mutational density across the genome was then calculated as the adjusted number of mutations in 50 kb windows for the aggregated set of mutations for all BRCA and LUAD tumours respectively (Fig. <a href=\"#Fig1\">1C</a>; “Methods” section).

Our analysis reveals three distinct patterns of substitution rates. First, a sharp decline in the deamination rate of methylated CpG dinucleotides, which is observed in the vicinity of the 5′ end of genes. Second, a strand asymmetry in complementary substitution rates, which extends from the 5′ end to 1 kbp downstream from the 3′ end, associated with transcription-coupled repair. Finally, a localized strand asymmetry, an excess of C→T over G→A substitution in the nontemplate strand confined to the first 1–2 kbp downstream of the 5′ end of genes. We hypothesize that higher exposure of the nontemplate strand near the 5′ end of genes leads to a higher cytosine deamination rate. Up to now, only the somatic hypermutation (SHM) pathway has been known to mediate localized and strand-specific mutagenic processes associated with transcription in mammalia. The mutational patterns in SHM are induced by cytosine deaminase, which just targets single-stranded DNA.

We predict that R-loops are extensively formed in the beginning of transcribed regions in germ line cells.</p></section><hr/>\n<p>Understanding the processes that lead to spontaneous DNA mutations is important for studies of genome evolution and the genesis of noninherited genetic diseases such as cancer. New mutations arise as a result of numerous processes that damage DNA and the unsuccessful repair of this damage by cellular repair pathways. Besides a certain level of background activity of these processes, mutagenic sources may additionally be influenced by the DNA sequence, the DNA structure, or processes of cellular metabolism like transcription and replication (<a href=\"#B41\">Maki 2002</a>). Up to now, little is known about the in vivo properties of these additional sources and less is known about the relative contribution of each source to the mutation patterns in the genome.</p>\n<p>Replication, and to a lesser extent, transcription, have been shown to affect nucleotide mutation rates in a variety of genomes. Hallmarks of these processes are particular strand asymmetries. In bacteria, the replication of the genome from one unique origin of replication promotes certain nucleotide substitutions within the two strands, generating heterogeneities in the base composition along the circular genome and strand asymmetries between the leading and lagging strand (<a href=\"#B37\">Lobry 1996</a>; <a href=\"#B32\">Kano-Sueoka et al. 1999</a>). In addition, transcription itself and transcription-coupled repair (TCR) processes (<a href=\"#B54\">Svejstrup 2002</a>) also lead to strand asymmetries between the template and nontemplate strand (<a href=\"#B48\">Rocha et al. 2006</a>). In particular, transcription can lead to an elevation of cytosine deamination rates on the nontemplate strand (<a href=\"#B6\">Beletskii and Bhagwat 1996</a>, <a href=\"#B7\">1998</a>).</p>\n<p>In higher eukaryotes, processes coupled to replication and transcription also affect the genomic sequence. In contrast to bacteria, DNA replication in higher eukaryotes initiates from multiple origins (<a href=\"#B17\">Francino and Ochman 2000</a>; <a href=\"#B3\">Aladjem 2007</a>). On an evolutionary timescale, segments of DNA might be replicated from the next 5′ or 3′ origin lowering or canceling strand asymmetries of the replication process. In a similar fashion, transcription occurs from both strands and from different origins. Yet, the impact of transcription is easier to detect, since transcription usually starts from well-defined transcription start sites and proceeds only in one direction to synthesize the RNA message. Moreover, most of the transcription start sites (TSSs) tend to be conserved, even between mammals (<a href=\"#B20\">Frith et al. 2006</a>; <a href=\"#B55\">Taylor et al. 2006</a>). This stability over long periods of time enables the accumulation of mutations associated with transcription, which can be observed by analyzing genomic sequence data.</p>\n<p>Biases in the nucleotide composition of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) have been used as evidence for biases in mutational processes or selection. According to Chargaff’s second parity rule, an asymmetry in the frequencies of complementary nucleotides on ssDNA, such as an excess of T over A, implies that mutation rates are not identical on the complementary strands (<a href=\"#B37\">Lobry 1996</a>). <a href=\"#B23\">Green et al. (2003)</a> have observed an excess of G+T over A+C on the nontemplate strand in human genes, which has later been found to be correlated with transcription levels (<a href=\"#B39\">Majewski 2003</a>). To quantify violations of Chargaff’s second parity rule, one introduces the TA skew = (T − A)/(T + A) and GC skew = (G − C)/(G + C). Both skews are found to be positive in mammalian nontemplate strands, but are close to zero in the 5′ flanking sequences of genes (<a href=\"#B57\">Touchon et al. 2004</a>).</p>\n<p>Previous studies further revealed that the nucleotide composition varies along transcribed DNA (<a href=\"#B38\">Louie et al. 2003</a>; <a href=\"#B57\">Touchon et al. 2004</a>). The TA and GC skews are found to be maximal at the immediate downstream region from the 5′ end of genes; further nucleotide densities are observed to be dependent on the distance from the 5′ end and 3′ end of introns (<a href=\"#B56\">Touchon et al. 2003</a>; <a href=\"#B1\">Aerts et al. 2004</a>; <a href=\"#B21\">Fujimori et al. 2005</a>). Apart from skews of complementary nucleotides, the GC content monotonically decreases with the increasing distance from the TSS in both directions (<a href=\"#B53\">Saxonov et al. 2006</a>). This regional behavior of the nucleotide composition in genes and their flanking regions imply corresponding regional behaviors of substitution processes. Yet, it is not clear whether and how mutational mechanisms vary along the transcripts.</p>\n<p>The signatures of mutational processes associated with transcription are particular strand asymmetries with respect to the template/nontemplate strand. For instance, using 1.5 Mbp of orthologous regions in chimpanzee and human, <a href=\"#B23\">Green et al. (2003)</a> calculated the rates of intronic nucleotide transitions, and found out that in the nontemplate strand the purine transitions (A→G and G→A) occurred at a higher rate than their complementary pyrimidine transitions. Later, a similar bias of A→G vs. T→C was reported in an analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in introns and fourfold degenerates (FFD) sites (<a href=\"#B47\">Qu et al. 2006</a>). This strand bias in substitution rates has been hypothesized to be a result of TCR and of different misinsertion rates for the four nucleotides (<a href=\"#B23\">Green et al. 2003</a>). Further on, <a href=\"#B28\">Hwang and Green (2004)</a> carried out an analysis of context dependence of mutation rates in 1.7-Mbp genomic regions across the phylogeny of 19 mammalians species. Beside the known asymmetries of complementary transition rates in transcribed regions, they also found similar (but weaker) asymmetries in the transversion rates. Some of these processes also showed signatures of neighbor dependencies.</p>\n<p>In this study we also use a comparative genomics approach to investigate a nucleotide substitution pattern in association with transcription. In contrast to previous studies, we especially want to investigate the spatial variations in these substitution patterns along the transcripts. The availability of genome-wide human–chimpanzee–rhesus alignments enabled us to estimate 12 single nucleotide substitution frequencies as well as the deamination rate of CpG dinucleotides surrounding the 5′ and 3′ ends of genes. In order to be able to resolve variations of substitution rates on a high spatial resolution, we had to keep the number of parameters in our model small (<a href=\"#B4\">Arndt and Hwa 2005</a>) and just included one neighbor-dependent substitution process, the CpG methylation deamination process (CpG→CpA and CpG→TpG), which is known to be the predominant substitution process in mammals (<a href=\"#B5\">Arndt et al. 2003</a>). In order to minimize the effects due to selection, we analyzed only intronic parts of genes and their 5′ and 3′ flanking intergenic sequences.</p>\n<p>We establish the regional patterns (with respect to the TSS) of nucleotide substitution rates in the human linage since the human–chimpanzee divergence. Our analysis reveals three types of regional patterns of substitution rates. The most pronounced behavior is a sharp decrease of CpG deamination in the proximity of the TSS. Further, we show that in intronic regions most of the substitutions rates are strand asymmetric. This strand asymmetry is not observed in intergenic regions upstream to the TSS, showing that transcription-coupled mechanisms are involved in this breaking of the strand symmetry. The first type of strand asymmetric pattern extends along the whole transcript: We measure an excess of A→G over T→C, A→T over T→A, C→G over G→C, and G→T over C→A on the nontemplate strand consistently along the whole transcript (naturally, the opposite asymmetries are found on the template strand). The second type of asymmetry is an excess of C→T over G→A transitions restricted to the immediate 1–2-kbp region downstream from the TSS. This localized asymmetry is found to be dependent both on the distance from the TSS and on local GC content. We argue that the mechanisms that are involved in the formation of local asymmetry might be coupled to transcription initiation and be involved in the somatic hypermutation pathway, which targets the first 1–2 kbp of genes. Finally, we show that these reg",

The signature usually consists of numerous genes that are differentially expressed between two clinically distinct groups of samples, such as tumor subtypes. Prospectively, many signatures have been found to generalize poorly to other datasets and, thus, have rarely been accepted into clinical use. Recognizing the limited success of traditionally generated signatures, we developed a systems biology-based framework for robust identification of key transcription factors and their genomic regulatory neighborhoods. Application of the framework to study the differences between gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and leiomyosarcoma (LMS) resulted in the identification of nine transcription factors (SRF, NKX2-5, CCDC6, LEF1, VDR, ZNF250, TRIM63, MAF, and MYC). Functional annotations of the obtained neighborhoods identified the biological processes which the key transcription factors regulate differently between the tumor types. Analyzing the differences in the expression patterns using our approach resulted in a more robust genetic signature and more biological insight into the diseases compared to a traditional genetic signature.</p>\n<section><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Systems biology, transcription factor, gene regulation, binding motif, sarcoma</p></section></section><section><h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Genetic diseases are attributed to changes in the expression pattern of one or more key genes. In cancer, abnormal expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is often caused by focal genetic events, including gene mutations and copy number changes, as well as epigenetic changes like altered promoter methylation<a href=\"#b1\">[1]</a><sup>–</sup><a href=\"#b3\">[3]</a>. Focal events are then followed by tumorigenic alterations in transcription programs, which further affect downstream gene expression patterns. A well known example of this trickle-down effect is the MDM2-p53 pathway. When MDM2, an inhibitor of the tumor suppressor gene p53, is deactivated by a single nucleotide polymorphism, p53 is overexpressed, resulting in aberrant expression of hundreds of downstream genes<a href=\"#b4\">[4]</a>. Thus, as gene expression is often controlled by hierarchical regulatory networks, experiments that measure expression patterns at steady-state levels, such as microarray, provide little insight into how gene expression is regulated.</p>\n<p>Given the limitations of steady-state experiments, many genomic studies are conducted solely to identify genes that either are differentially expressed between two clinical groups, such as tumors with different clinical characteristics <a href=\"#b5\">[5]</a><sup>–</sup><a href=\"#b19\">[19]</a>, or are correlated with clinical parameters like patient survival. The signature genes identified in these studies can be used, for example, as features in computational classifiers for discriminating patients as poor or long survivors, or as responders or non-responders to treatment. Nevertheless, although signature genes for some tumor subclasses have been successfully identified using computational methods, most signature gene lists have been found highly unstable and unreliable in prospective studies. III-conceived experiments, lack of clinical validation, biased selection of signature molecules, and overly positive error estimates for classifiers have been deemed downfalls of this approach in practice<a href=\"#b20\">[20]</a><sup>–</sup><a href=\"#b25\">[25]</a>. Further, global gene lists fail to shed light on molecular relationships and the biological difference that gene dysregulation conveys to the phenotype. An additional significant problem is that signature genes are often passive bystanders (“passenger genes”) that do not have a major driving function (“driver genes”) in the disease, such as promoting faster relapse or conveying resistance to treatment.</p>\n<p>As a result of the shortcomings of gene-level analyses, there has been a transition towards module-level analysis of gene regulation. Several investigators propose that it is imperative to analyze smaller, coherent sets of genes instead of global signatures <a href=\"#b26\">[26]</a><sup>–</sup><a href=\"#b32\">[32]</a>. The coherence of a gene set can be defined without knowing the network topology by such parameters as shared biological function, molecule type or localization, such as in Gene Ontology <a href=\"#b33\">[33]</a>; or topologically, by genetic regulatory connections or other physical interactions. Gene regulatory networks include signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, and disease pathways and are made publicly available in several databases <a href=\"#b34\">[34]</a><sup>,</sup><a href=\"#b35\">[35]</a>.

The signature usually consists of numerous genes that are differentially expressed between two clinically distinct groups of samples, such as tumor subtypes. Prospectively, many signatures have been found to generalize poorly to other datasets and, thus, have rarely been accepted into clinical use. Recognizing the limited success of traditionally generated signatures, we developed a systems biology-based framework for robust identification of key transcription factors and their genomic regulatory neighborhoods. Application of the framework to study the differences between gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and leiomyosarcoma (LMS) resulted in the identification of nine transcription factors (SRF, NKX2-5, CCDC6, LEF1, VDR, ZNF250, TRIM63, MAF, and MYC). Functional annotations of the obtained neighborhoods identified the biological processes which the key transcription factors regulate differently between the tumor types. Analyzing the differences in the expression patterns using our approach resulted in a more robust genetic signature and more biological insight into the diseases compared to a traditional genetic signature.</p>\n<section><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Systems biology, transcription factor, gene regulation, binding motif, sarcoma</p></section></section><section><h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Genetic diseases are attributed to changes in the expression pattern of one or more key genes. In cancer, abnormal expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is often caused by focal genetic events, including gene mutations and copy number changes, as well as epigenetic changes like altered promoter methylation<a href=\"#b1\">[1]</a><sup>–</sup><a href=\"#b3\">[3]</a>. Focal events are then followed by tumorigenic alterations in transcription programs, which further affect downstream gene expression patterns. A well known example of this trickle-down effect is the MDM2-p53 pathway. When MDM2, an inhibitor of the tumor suppressor gene p53, is deactivated by a single nucleotide polymorphism, p53 is overexpressed, resulting in aberrant expression of hundreds of downstream genes<a href=\"#b4\">[4]</a>. Thus, as gene expression is often controlled by hierarchical regulatory networks, experiments that measure expression patterns at steady-state levels, such as microarray, provide little insight into how gene expression is regulated.</p>\n<p>Given the limitations of steady-state experiments, many genomic studies are conducted solely to identify genes that either are differentially expressed between two clinical groups, such as tumors with different clinical characteristics <a href=\"#b5\">[5]</a><sup>–</sup><a href=\"#b19\">[19]</a>, or are correlated with clinical parameters like patient survival. The signature genes identified in these studies can be used, for example, as features in computational classifiers for discriminating patients as poor or long survivors, or as responders or non-responders to treatment. Nevertheless, although signature genes for some tumor subclasses have been successfully identified using computational methods, most signature gene lists have been found highly unstable and unreliable in prospective studies. III-conceived experiments, lack of clinical validation, biased selection of signature molecules, and overly positive error estimates for classifiers have been deemed downfalls of this approach in practice<a href=\"#b20\">[20]</a><sup>–</sup><a href=\"#b25\">[25]</a>. Further, global gene lists fail to shed light on molecular relationships and the biological difference that gene dysregulation conveys to the phenotype. An additional significant problem is that signature genes are often passive bystanders (“passenger genes”) that do not have a major driving function (“driver genes”) in the disease, such as promoting faster relapse or conveying resistance to treatment.</p>\n<p>As a result of the shortcomings of gene-level analyses, there has been a transition towards module-level analysis of gene regulation. Several investigators propose that it is imperative to analyze smaller, coherent sets of genes instead of global signatures <a href=\"#b26\">[26]</a><sup>–</sup><a href=\"#b32\">[32]</a>. The coherence of a gene set can be defined without knowing the network topology by such parameters as shared biological function, molecule type or localization, such as in Gene Ontology <a href=\"#b33\">[33]</a>; or topologically, by genetic regulatory connections or other physical interactions. Gene regulatory networks include signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, and disease pathways and are made publicly available in several databases <a href=\"#b34\">[34]</a><sup>,</sup><a href=\"#b35\">[35]</a>.

Enhancers are typically rapidly evolving and are frequently species-specific<sup><a href=\"#ref-CR1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR2\">2</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR3\">3</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR4\">4</a></sup>. For example, most human enhancers are not found in the mouse<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR3\">3</a></sup>.</p><p>The factors responsible for enhancer turnover are not well understood. The prevailing model of enhancer evolution is the mobilization of transposable elements (TE) and their insertions to new genomic locations<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR5\">5</a></sup>. As TEs are commonly found overlapping enhancers, they have been hypothesized to play a major role in the dynamic landscape of enhancer turnover in mammals by distributing cis-regulatory elements across the genome. However, they do not account for most recently evolved mammalian enhancers, many of which appear to have originated from ancestral sequences without prior biochemical activity in the same tissue<sup><a href=\"#ref-CR6\">6</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR7\">7</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR8\">8</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR9\">9</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR10\">10</a></sup>.</p><p>Notably, local point mutations in non-regulatory sequences can give rise to enhancer activity, suggesting an alternative mechanism for generating tissue-specific enhancers<sup><a href=\"#ref-CR11\">11</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR12\">12</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR13\">13</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR14\">14</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR15\">15</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR16\">16</a></sup>. One of the most significant predictors of local mutational density is DNA replication time<sup><a href=\"#ref-CR17\">17</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR18\">18</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR19\">19</a></sup>. De novo mutations are elevated at late replicating genome regions corresponding to the latter stages of S-phase - a phenomenon that is potentially due to a reduced ability of DNA repair mechanisms to function effectively during late replication time<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR20\">20</a></sup>. In hominids and rodents, mutation rates are 20–30% higher at late compared to early replication domains<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR21\">21</a></sup>, and this trend of accelerated mutational rate extends throughout eukaryotic evolution<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR22\">22</a></sup>. The DNA replication timing program, defined by the temporal order of DNA replication during the S-phase, is also closely linked to the spatial organization of chromatin in the nucleus and transcriptional activity<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR23\">23</a></sup>. Late replicating domains are associated with facultative heterochromatin and tissue-specific gene expression<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR24\">24</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR25\">25</a></sup>.</p><p>Thus, we hypothesized that DNA replication timing plays a role in the emergence and diversification of enhancers through de novo mutations<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR2\">2</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR26\">26</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR27\">27</a></sup>. In the context of enhancer turnover in mammals, we investigate the role of nucleotide substitutions linked to DNA replication timing. Using detailed maps of candidate cis-regulatory elements across species, we take a multi-scale approach to explore the relations between enhancer turnover and the genome. We examine the contribution of TEs and the de novo creation of TF binding sites to enhancer turnover. By comparing enhancers across DNA replication domains and their tissue-specific activity across vastly different time scales, we aim to illuminate the evolutionary trajectories of enhancers and their implications for gene regulation.</p></div></div><div><h2>Results</h2><div><h3>Germline replication time is associated with the rate of enhancer turnover across the genome</h3><p>Genetic changes occurring in the germline provide genetic variation that is the substrate for species evolution.

As TEs are commonly found overlapping enhancers, they have been hypothesized to play a major role in the dynamic landscape of enhancer turnover in mammals by distributing cis-regulatory elements across the genome. However, they do not account for most recently evolved mammalian enhancers, many of which appear to have originated from ancestral sequences without prior biochemical activity in the same tissue<sup><a href=\"#ref-CR6\">6</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR7\">7</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR8\">8</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR9\">9</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR10\">10</a></sup>.</p><p>Notably, local point mutations in non-regulatory sequences can give rise to enhancer activity, suggesting an alternative mechanism for generating tissue-specific enhancers<sup><a href=\"#ref-CR11\">11</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR12\">12</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR13\">13</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR14\">14</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR15\">15</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR16\">16</a></sup>.

De novo mutations are elevated at late replicating genome regions corresponding to the latter stages of S-phase - a phenomenon that is potentially due to a reduced ability of DNA repair mechanisms to function effectively during late replication time<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR20\">20</a></sup>. In hominids and rodents, mutation rates are 20–30% higher at late compared to early replication domains<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR21\">21</a></sup>, and this trend of accelerated mutational rate extends throughout eukaryotic evolution<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR22\">22</a></sup>. The DNA replication timing program, defined by the temporal order of DNA replication during the S-phase, is also closely linked to the spatial organization of chromatin in the nucleus and transcriptional activity<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47391-5#ref-CR23\">23</a></sup>.

        "text": "<div><div><h3>1. Introduction</h3>\n<p>In this theme issue of the <i>Transactions</i>, we have drawn together a selection of papers that address a common question: how is the newish field of epigenetics impacting the now mature field of evolutionary biology? Much of our contemporary understanding of how evolution works is captured in a body of theory that developed in the 1940s known as the ‘Modern Synthesis' (MS) [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C2\">2</a>]. The MS was pivotal because it reconciled Mendel's demonstration that inheritance is particulate with Darwin's theory of natural selection on continuous variation, and incorporated Fisher's [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C3\">3</a>] contributions to population genetics. The MS view of evolution can be summarized by the statement that evolution proceeds by changes in allele frequencies within and between populations as a consequence of natural selection, population subdivision and genetic drift [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C4\">4</a>]. The MS explicitly rejects the possibility of inheritance of acquired characteristics [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C5\">5</a>]. This assumption was later reinforced by Crick's ‘Central Dogma’ of molecular biology, the idea that information held in DNA is transcribed into messenger RNAs that are then translated into an amino acid sequence in a protein, with no possibility of feedback of information from protein to the DNA [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C6\">6</a>]. Furthermore, while quantitative geneticists and animal breeders have always recognized the importance of parental (typically maternal) effects in determining the phenotype of offspring [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C7\">7</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C8\">8</a>], parental effects were regarded as having little or no consequence for evolution because they lasted one or two generations at most, and had a negligible bearing on allele frequencies.</p>\n<p>Despite the contemporary ascendence of the MS view of evolution, especially among field-based evolutionary biologists, there has been, ever since its inception, an alternative narrative [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C5\">5</a>]. In the same year that Huxley's [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C1\">1</a>] book promoting the MS was published, Conrad Waddington sent a letter to <i>Nature</i> that has the following passage:</p><p>The battle, which raged so long, between the theories of evolution supported by geneticists on one hand and naturalists on the other, has in recent years gone strongly in favour of the former … The classical ‘naturalist' theory—the inheritance of acquired characteristics—has been very generally relegated to the background … [because] it has required a type of heredity … for the existence of which there was no adequate evidence. Naturalists cannot fail to be continually and deeply impressed by the adaptation of the organism to its surroundings … These adaptive characters are inherited and some explanation must be provided. If we are deprived of the hypothesis of the inheritance of … [acquired characteristics], we seem thrown back on an exclusive reliance on the natural selection of merely chance mutations. It is doubtful, however, whether even the most statistically minded geneticists are entirely satisfied that nothing more is involved than sorting out of random mutations by the natural selective filter [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C9\">9</a>, p. 563].</p>\n<p>Waddington goes on to postulate an evolutionary mechanism that acts in concert with natural selection that he termed ‘genetic assimilation'. The essence of the genetic assimilation argument is based on another of Waddington's ideas: ‘canalization'. Waddington argued that while the genotypes of a population tend to be highly variable, the phenotypes are not. Therefore, despite a variable environment and the interactions of dozens or hundreds of highly variable genes contributing to a phenotype, their sum tends to lead to a remarkably similar phenotypic outcome [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C9\">9</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C10\">10</a>]. Waddington proposed that natural selection acts on the regulation of gene networks so that the networks canalize ‘normal’ development to what he called ‘wild-type', the common phenotype in the wild. Our modern understanding of the way gene networks work tends to endorse Waddington's view, in that there is enormous redundancy, buffering and feedback within them [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C11\">11</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C12\">12</a>]. Both empirical and theoretical studies show that this redundancy tends to produce the same phenotypic outcome, even if one or two genes within the network are significantly over or under expressed as a result of mutation, or if an organism is subjected to an extreme environmental challenge [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C11\">11</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C13\">13</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C14\">14</a>].</p>\n<p>But what does canalization have to do with genetic assimilation? Waddington's argument, which in our view is persuasive, was that the expression of any extreme phenotype that has been observed in nature must be genotypically possible. That is, the <i>possibility</i> of extreme phenotypes must lurk within the normal genome. These extreme phenotypes are only expressed when an environmental or genetic challenge is sufficient to reveal them. Therefore, the selection on the <i>regulation</i> of a gene network alone should be sufficient to produce the same extreme phenotype <i>without change in the average genotype</i> of the genes that directly contribute to a trait [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C5\">5</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C15\">15</a>–<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C17\">17</a>].</p>\n<p>This brings us to epigenetics. The term ‘epigenetics' was also coined by Waddington [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C18\">18</a>] to mean the processes whereby the ‘genes of the genotype bring about phenotypic effects'. But this definition has evolved and multiplied [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C19\">19</a>]. Today it is typically used to mean the transfer of information beyond DNA sequence between cell divisions, that influences gene regulation [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C20\">20</a>–<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C24\">24</a>]. Epigenetic processes are central to embryogenesis, helping to guide the development of a fertilized egg into a mature organism with specialist cells, tissues and organs, all of which express different sets of genes in different cell lineages. Epigenetic states are of three main kinds, which we briefly describe below.

A nucleosome is made of 147 nucleotides (nt) of DNA wrapped around a multiprotein core made up of two copies of each of the four histones H2A H2B, H3 and H4. Nucleosomes limit access to the DNA, and must be loosened up to allow transcription. This loosening is favoured or hampered depending, notably, on post-translation modifications to histones such as acetylation, methylation or phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues. Chromatin states can be retained across cell divisions and in part, this unifies the genes that are switched on and off in different cell lineages and, eventually, tissues and organs [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C20\">20</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C28\">28</a>].</p>\n<h4>(b) DNA methylation</h4>\n<p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to specific nucleotides, mainly cytosines (Cs), in eukaryotes.

Introduction</h3>\n<p>In this theme issue of the <i>Transactions</i>, we have drawn together a selection of papers that address a common question: how is the newish field of epigenetics impacting the now mature field of evolutionary biology? Much of our contemporary understanding of how evolution works is captured in a body of theory that developed in the 1940s known as the ‘Modern Synthesis' (MS) [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C2\">2</a>]. The MS was pivotal because it reconciled Mendel's demonstration that inheritance is particulate with Darwin's theory of natural selection on continuous variation, and incorporated Fisher's [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C3\">3</a>] contributions to population genetics. The MS view of evolution can be summarized by the statement that evolution proceeds by changes in allele frequencies within and between populations as a consequence of natural selection, population subdivision and genetic drift [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C4\">4</a>]. The MS explicitly rejects the possibility of inheritance of acquired characteristics [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C5\">5</a>]. This assumption was later reinforced by Crick's ‘Central Dogma’ of molecular biology, the idea that information held in DNA is transcribed into messenger RNAs that are then translated into an amino acid sequence in a protein, with no possibility of feedback of information from protein to the DNA [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C6\">6</a>]. Furthermore, while quantitative geneticists and animal breeders have always recognized the importance of parental (typically maternal) effects in determining the phenotype of offspring [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C7\">7</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C8\">8</a>], parental effects were regarded as having little or no consequence for evolution because they lasted one or two generations at most, and had a negligible bearing on allele frequencies.</p>\n<p>Despite the contemporary ascendence of the MS view of evolution, especially among field-based evolutionary biologists, there has been, ever since its inception, an alternative narrative [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C5\">5</a>]. In the same year that Huxley's [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C1\">1</a>] book promoting the MS was published, Conrad Waddington sent a letter to <i>Nature</i> that has the following passage:</p><p>The battle, which raged so long, between the theories of evolution supported by geneticists on one hand and naturalists on the other, has in recent years gone strongly in favour of the former … The classical ‘naturalist' theory—the inheritance of acquired characteristics—has been very generally relegated to the background … [because] it has required a type of heredity … for the existence of which there was no adequate evidence. Naturalists cannot fail to be continually and deeply impressed by the adaptation of the organism to its surroundings … These adaptive characters are inherited and some explanation must be provided. If we are deprived of the hypothesis of the inheritance of … [acquired characteristics], we seem thrown back on an exclusive reliance on the natural selection of merely chance mutations. It is doubtful, however, whether even the most statistically minded geneticists are entirely satisfied that nothing more is involved than sorting out of random mutations by the natural selective filter [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C9\">9</a>, p. 563].</p>\n<p>Waddington goes on to postulate an evolutionary mechanism that acts in concert with natural selection that he termed ‘genetic assimilation'. The essence of the genetic assimilation argument is based on another of Waddington's ideas: ‘canalization'. Waddington argued that while the genotypes of a population tend to be highly variable, the phenotypes are not. Therefore, despite a variable environment and the interactions of dozens or hundreds of highly variable genes contributing to a phenotype, their sum tends to lead to a remarkably similar phenotypic outcome [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C9\">9</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C10\">10</a>]. Waddington proposed that natural selection acts on the regulation of gene networks so that the networks canalize ‘normal’ development to what he called ‘wild-type', the common phenotype in the wild. Our modern understanding of the way gene networks work tends to endorse Waddington's view, in that there is enormous redundancy, buffering and feedback within them [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C11\">11</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C12\">12</a>]. Both empirical and theoretical studies show that this redundancy tends to produce the same phenotypic outcome, even if one or two genes within the network are significantly over or under expressed as a result of mutation, or if an organism is subjected to an extreme environmental challenge [<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C11\">11</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C13\">13</a>,<a href=\"#RSTB20200111C14\">14</a>].</p>\n<p>But what does canalization have to do with genetic assimilation?

However, instances of inadequate communication from the sci\u0002entific community about confidence levels, knowledge gaps, reliability, and appropri\u0002ate parameters of eDNA-based methods have hindered their uptake in environmental\nmonitoring programs and, in some cases, has created misperceptions or doubts in the\nmanagement community. To help remedy this situation, scientists convened a session\nat the Second National Marine eDNA Workshop to discuss strategies for improving\ncommunications with managers. These include articulating the readiness of different\neDNA applications, highlighting the strengths and limitations of eDNA tools for vari\u0002ous applications or use cases, communicating uncertainties associated with specified\nuses transparently, and avoiding the exaggeration of exploratory and preliminary find\u0002ings. Several key messages regarding implementation, limitations, and relationship to\nexisting methods were prioritized. To be inclusive of the diverse managers, practi\u0002tioners, and researchers, we and the other workshop participants propose the de\u0002velopment of communication workflow plans, using RACI (Responsible, Accountable,\nSCCWRP #1339\n2 of 12 | STEIN et al.\n1 | THE CHALLENGE WITH\nCOMMUNICATING EDNA-BASED RESULTS\nAgencies regulating, managing, restoring, and protecting water\nresources must be able to monitor and assess the ecological func\u0002tion or condition of aquatic ecosystems. Aquatic ecosystems are\nsubject to multiple stressors and chronic changes associated with\nshifting climatic patterns and changing water resource demand\n(Häder et al., 2020). Ecosystem conditions including stress are\ncommonly measured by assessing biological community composi\u0002tion, biodiversity, or dynamics of key ecological functional groups.\nThese findings guide management responses and discern the ef\u0002fectiveness of management interventions. Conventional biomoni\u0002toring tasks are often constrained to small spatial scales and short\ntemporal windows, and many, if not most, methods are selective in\nsurveyed species or habitats (Birk et al., 2012; Friberg et al., 2011).\nImproving monitoring methods by expanding measures across\nspace, time, and environments is labor-intensive and financially\nchallenging. New methods capable of rapid and economic data de\u0002livery can support and complement conventional monitoring and\naid evidence-based management of global aquatic ecosystems and\nwater resources.\nThe economic and methodological efficiency of environmental\nDNA (eDNA) based methods can reduce monitoring constraints\nby increasing existing monitoring programs' spatial, temporal, and\ntaxonomic resolutions (Thompson & Thielen, 2023). Including\nsingle-species (e.g., PCR, qPCR, and ddPCR) or multi-species (e.g.,\nmetabarcoding) eDNA approaches in a monitoring toolbox is a cost\u0002effective mechanism to broaden biomonitoring, examine composi\u0002tional turnover across scales, and uncover patterns and responses to\nchanging ecological conditions (Pawlowski et al., 2020). Deploying\neDNA methods has proven effective for aquatic biodiversity mon\u0002itoring and species surveillance (McElroy et al., 2020; Sepulveda,\nNelson, et al., 2020) by improving the assessment of target taxa at\nlow population densities (Adams et al., 2019; Schenekar, 2023; Wil\u0002cox et al., 2016).\nImplementation of eDNA-based methods for suitable applica\u0002tions has been hampered in part by inadequate communication re\u0002garding result uncertainties (i.e., Type 1/Type 2 errors; confidence\nestimates for detection probabilities), performance consistency,\nand the fact that the state of the science varies depending on the\neDNA application, with some applications needing more research\nand development than others. Differences between laboratory sci\u0002entists, ecologists, managers, and other practitioners in understand\u0002ing and speaking about molecular assay performance can exacerbate\ndata quality issues and lead to misinterpretation of results (Mosher\net al., 2020). Communication deficiencies around using eDNA data\nhave contributed to implementation delays in monitoring and as\u0002sessment programs. They can lead to skepticism or distrust by some\nin the management community, particularly if communicated results\nfail to differentiate between a lack of species detection and an as\u0002sumption of absence. Shortcomings in eDNA science communica\u0002tion detailed in previous reviews include: 1. Miscommunication of\nvalid eDNA results in a high-profile, incipient invasion of the Lauren\u0002tian Great Lakes by bigheaded carps (Jerde, 2021); 2. Misrepresen\u0002tation of uncertainties associated with monitoring results (Darling\net al., 2021); 3. Inflated claims of applications before confirmatory\nevidence is broadly available (Sepulveda, Nelson, et al., 2020);\n4. Inappropriate extrapolation of preliminary results (Darling &\nMahon, 2011); and 5. Insufficient explanation and guidance on dif\u0002ferent eDNA approaches resulting in assessments being viewed as a\ngeneralized “black box” (Morisette et al., 2021). Hence clear, consis\u0002tent, and accurate communication about eDNA approaches that is\naccessible to a non-specialist audience is urgently needed.\nTo provide the improved communication needed to remedy\nskepticism, scientists must build trust with end-user communities by\nunderstanding and embracing their needs (Aylagas et al., 2020; Hall\net al., 2021). Scientists need to communicate both the limitations and\nadvantages of emerging technologies and assessment approaches\nfor management applications. Goldstein et al. (2020) suggested that\nscience communication can be improved by embracing strategies\nof storytelling, being strategic about responses we hope to elicit,\nConsulted, Informed) charts to clarify the roles of all pertinent individuals and parties\nand to minimize the chance for miscommunications. We also propose developing de\u0002cision support tools such as Structured Decision-Making (SDM) to help balance the\nbenefits of eDNA sampling with the inherent uncertainty, and developing an eDNA\nreadiness scale to articulate the technological readiness of eDNA approaches for spe\u0002cific applications. These strategies will increase clarity and consistency regarding our\nunderstanding of the utility of eDNA-based methods, improve transparency, foster a\ncommon vision for confidently applying eDNA approaches, and enhance their benefit\nto the monitoring and assessment community.\nKEYWORDS\ncommunication workflow, decision support tools, eDNA, implementation readiness, RACI\ncharts, transition to management, transparency\n26374943, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/edn3.472, Wiley Online Library on [13/02/2024].

However, instances of inadequate communication from the sci\u0002entific community about confidence levels, knowledge gaps, reliability, and appropri\u0002ate parameters of eDNA-based methods have hindered their uptake in environmental\nmonitoring programs and, in some cases, has created misperceptions or doubts in the\nmanagement community. To help remedy this situation, scientists convened a session\nat the Second National Marine eDNA Workshop to discuss strategies for improving\ncommunications with managers. These include articulating the readiness of different\neDNA applications, highlighting the strengths and limitations of eDNA tools for vari\u0002ous applications or use cases, communicating uncertainties associated with specified\nuses transparently, and avoiding the exaggeration of exploratory and preliminary find\u0002ings. Several key messages regarding implementation, limitations, and relationship to\nexisting methods were prioritized. To be inclusive of the diverse managers, practi\u0002tioners, and researchers, we and the other workshop participants propose the de\u0002velopment of communication workflow plans, using RACI (Responsible, Accountable,\nSCCWRP #1339\n2 of 12 | STEIN et al.\n1 | THE CHALLENGE WITH\nCOMMUNICATING EDNA-BASED RESULTS\nAgencies regulating, managing, restoring, and protecting water\nresources must be able to monitor and assess the ecological func\u0002tion or condition of aquatic ecosystems. Aquatic ecosystems are\nsubject to multiple stressors and chronic changes associated with\nshifting climatic patterns and changing water resource demand\n(Häder et al., 2020). Ecosystem conditions including stress are\ncommonly measured by assessing biological community composi\u0002tion, biodiversity, or dynamics of key ecological functional groups.\nThese findings guide management responses and discern the ef\u0002fectiveness of management interventions. Conventional biomoni\u0002toring tasks are often constrained to small spatial scales and short\ntemporal windows, and many, if not most, methods are selective in\nsurveyed species or habitats (Birk et al., 2012; Friberg et al., 2011).\nImproving monitoring methods by expanding measures across\nspace, time, and environments is labor-intensive and financially\nchallenging. New methods capable of rapid and economic data de\u0002livery can support and complement conventional monitoring and\naid evidence-based management of global aquatic ecosystems and\nwater resources.\nThe economic and methodological efficiency of environmental\nDNA (eDNA) based methods can reduce monitoring constraints\nby increasing existing monitoring programs' spatial, temporal, and\ntaxonomic resolutions (Thompson & Thielen, 2023). Including\nsingle-species (e.g., PCR, qPCR, and ddPCR) or multi-species (e.g.,\nmetabarcoding) eDNA approaches in a monitoring toolbox is a cost\u0002effective mechanism to broaden biomonitoring, examine composi\u0002tional turnover across scales, and uncover patterns and responses to\nchanging ecological conditions (Pawlowski et al., 2020). Deploying\neDNA methods has proven effective for aquatic biodiversity mon\u0002itoring and species surveillance (McElroy et al., 2020; Sepulveda,\nNelson, et al., 2020) by improving the assessment of target taxa at\nlow population densities (Adams et al., 2019; Schenekar, 2023; Wil\u0002cox et al., 2016).\nImplementation of eDNA-based methods for suitable applica\u0002tions has been hampered in part by inadequate communication re\u0002garding result uncertainties (i.e., Type 1/Type 2 errors; confidence\nestimates for detection probabilities), performance consistency,\nand the fact that the state of the science varies depending on the\neDNA application, with some applications needing more research\nand development than others. Differences between laboratory sci\u0002entists, ecologists, managers, and other practitioners in understand\u0002ing and speaking about molecular assay performance can exacerbate\ndata quality issues and lead to misinterpretation of results (Mosher\net al., 2020). Communication deficiencies around using eDNA data\nhave contributed to implementation delays in monitoring and as\u0002sessment programs. They can lead to skepticism or distrust by some\nin the management community, particularly if communicated results\nfail to differentiate between a lack of species detection and an as\u0002sumption of absence. Shortcomings in eDNA science communica\u0002tion detailed in previous reviews include: 1. Miscommunication of\nvalid eDNA results in a high-profile, incipient invasion of the Lauren\u0002tian Great Lakes by bigheaded carps (Jerde, 2021); 2. Misrepresen\u0002tation of uncertainties associated with monitoring results (Darling\net al., 2021); 3. Inflated claims of applications before confirmatory\nevidence is broadly available (Sepulveda, Nelson, et al., 2020);\n4. Inappropriate extrapolation of preliminary results (Darling &\nMahon, 2011); and 5. Insufficient explanation and guidance on dif\u0002ferent eDNA approaches resulting in assessments being viewed as a\ngeneralized “black box” (Morisette et al., 2021). Hence clear, consis\u0002tent, and accurate communication about eDNA approaches that is\naccessible to a non-specialist audience is urgently needed.\nTo provide the improved communication needed to remedy\nskepticism, scientists must build trust with end-user communities by\nunderstanding and embracing their needs (Aylagas et al., 2020; Hall\net al., 2021). Scientists need to communicate both the limitations and\nadvantages of emerging technologies and assessment approaches\nfor management applications. Goldstein et al. (2020) suggested that\nscience communication can be improved by embracing strategies\nof storytelling, being strategic about responses we hope to elicit,\nConsulted, Informed) charts to clarify the roles of all pertinent individuals and parties\nand to minimize the chance for miscommunications. We also propose developing de\u0002cision support tools such as Structured Decision-Making (SDM) to help balance the\nbenefits of eDNA sampling with the inherent uncertainty, and developing an eDNA\nreadiness scale to articulate the technological readiness of eDNA approaches for spe\u0002cific applications. These strategies will increase clarity and consistency regarding our\nunderstanding of the utility of eDNA-based methods, improve transparency, foster a\ncommon vision for confidently applying eDNA approaches, and enhance their benefit\nto the monitoring and assessment community.\nKEYWORDS\ncommunication workflow, decision support tools, eDNA, implementation readiness, RACI\ncharts, transition to management, transparency\n26374943, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/edn3.472, Wiley Online Library on [13/02/2024].

We learn through interactions with others, the external world, and our internal world. Knowledge is neither fixed nor objective, but shaped and negotiated through social interactions and conversations.</p>\n<p>From this holistic lens, learning can be understood as reflective, reflexive, and experiential.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning reflects the conceptual knowledge of society.</li>\n<li>Learning is reflexive because it happens in response to something.</li>\n<li>Learning is experiential because it involves actively engaging with experiences and actively constructing knowledge from those experiences.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Construction of Collective Concepts: Statistical Learning</h3>\n<p>Let’s zoom out and consider how we learn concepts. Concepts are the building blocks of knowledge.</p>\n<p>“Without concepts, you’d experience a world of ever-fluctuating noise. Everything you ever encounter would be unlike everything else” (Barrett, 2015, p. 85).</p>\n<p>We are inundated with external stimuli in every moment. To make meaning of what would otherwise be constant noise, we rely on the categorization of stimuli into categories according to similar attributes, which form concepts.</p>\n<p>Statistical learning is the ability to learn from patterns- it is a co-creative experience that happens unintentionally. Our brains use statistical learning to create concepts (Barrett, 2015). Statistical learning begins in childhood and continues through adulthood (Sherman et al., 2020). It happens when we are exposed to stimuli in various contexts and infer meaning. Unlike learning that engages the reward system, statistical learning is not modulated by rewards; it happens automatically and outside of conscious awareness (Sherman et al., 2020).</p>\n<p>Over time, our brains create a prototype for a stimulus that is the conceptual <em>best example</em>. All other similar stimuli are interpreted based on this prototype. The concepts related to a prototype don’t have hard edges; rather, they are malleable and can adapt to similar stimuli.</p>\n<p>Let’s think about soft drinks – any type of sugary, fizzy drink. A small percentage of you will know these drinks as <em>soft drinks</em>. More likely, you call these drinks <em>soda, pop, or coke,</em> depending on where you live. Let’s zoom in on those of us who call soft drinks <em>coke</em>. A soft drink does not have to be a Coca-Cola product to be called a <em>coke</em> in the US South. In Georgia, for example, a Sprite is called a <em>coke</em>. If you visit a restaurant in Georgia, where Coca-Cola originated, and ask for a coke, the waitstaff will likely ask, “Sure, what kind of coke do you want?” And you would have to say <em>coke</em> again to get a Coca-Cola Classic soft drink. Most Georgians’ concept of coke includes not only Coca-Cola but all the other soft drinks that exist. In the Northeast, though. A soft drink is likely called a <em>soda</em>. Several subcategories exist within the concept of soda, like caffeinated, non-caffeinated, or by brand name, such as Pepsi products, Coca-Cola products, etc.</p>\n<p>The point is that stimuli need not be <em>exact</em> to enact prior knowledge, Several internal and external factors determine whether a stimulus fits within the bounds of a concept, and if it doesn’t, it ends up in another category or a subcategory. In the example, you can see how the edges of our conceptual prototypes are influenced by culture. The concept is updated in the moment.</p>\n<p>Statistical learning has interesting implications in education because it will reflect the semantic knowledge of the dominant culture. Embedded within the historical and societal constructs are broader cultural messages that are subconsciously learned.</p>\n<p>This means that even when students study alone, they build upon knowledge and concepts heavily influenced by society’s norms.</p>\n<h3>A Balance of Prediction and Present Moment Experience: Intentional Learning</h3>\n<p>Our brains make predictions based on statistical learning, instinct, and other lived experiences. In theory, the more experience we have, the better our predictions become.</p>\n<p>“Through prediction and correction, your brain continually creates and revises your mental model of the world. It’s a huge, ongoing simulation that constructs everything you perceive while determining how you act.” (Barrett, 2015, p. 62)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But we can’t rely on predictions alone. When we want to change a habit, affective state, or belief that no longer serves us, we must balance prediction with mindfulness of our present moment experience. Intentional learning involves a balance of prediction (based on our conceptual understandings) and sensory input from the present moment. In this way, learning is relational, drawing from past experiences, and reflexive, adapting to new stimuli.</p>\n<p>This means that a good portion of the learning experience occurs outside of conscious awareness.</p>\n<p>How can we teach to the part of learning that is outside of conscious awareness?</p>\n<p>In the following passage, we will explore psychological safety, balancing power in the classroom, and how to engage in the intentional co-construction of meaning through generative dialogue, counter-storytelling, and identity texts.</p>\n<h3>Psychological Safety</h3>\n<p>Co-construction in the classroom requires psychological safety. Safety begins with an understanding of trauma.</p>\n<h4>Trauma-informed Classroom</h4>\n<p>To create psychological safety in the classroom for the hundreds of millions of children who live with daily trauma, such as poverty, interpersonal violence, oppression, racism, and others, we must apply a trauma-informed lens. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) (2022), one billion children around the world experienced some form of trauma in a year-long-period, and, as noted by the Urban Child Institute (2012), these experiences can have lasting effects on student development when educators misunderstand them. Additionally, learners today experience climate anxiety, resource depletion, and the relational complexities of navigating social media (UNESCO et al., 2012).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The educator’s job is to prepare learners for a journey– one that will be perilous and rewarding, and full of grief, joy, and moments of uncertainty.</p>\n<div>\n<p>\n</p><h4>Join the Beckley Academy Mailing List</h4>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n<h4>At Risk Populations</h4>\n<h5>Students with Learning Differences</h5>\n<p>Traditional teaching methods risk retraumatizing students, eliciting shame, and otherwise challenging already at-risk learners. My student population consisted of learners with numerous learning differences, such as ADHD, Asperger’s, dyslexia, dysgraphic, and other cognitive issues with memory retrieval, comprehension, and verbal expression. Many of the students I taught had failed out of public school or had been asked to leave a school because of behavior or academic issues. Traditional reading and writing activities elicited shame, avoidance, and dissociation in my student population, due to predictions based on their past experiences. Understanding my students’ predictive models for reading and writing allowed me to see their behaviors as protective functions, rather than as disinterest or defiance.</p>\n<h5>Migrant Students</h5>\n<p>Migrant students, who have often left their home countries because of traumatic experiences of war, poverty, or oppression, are another population at risk of retraumatization from traditional teaching methods. Often migrant children enter parts of the country that hold deeply-seated prejudice and racist beliefs (Tamer, 2014). Their transition into the US school system is extremely challenging, as they navigate racism along with being the new kid immersed in a new culture, and often without a strong family support system at home (Cardoza, 2019). To compound the difficulties that migrant children face, the majority of classes in the US are conducted in English, with little acceptance of multilingual communication (Tamer, 2014). Because of this, migrant children often feel a sense of alienation, a lack of belonging, and low self-esteem. They begin to view their first language (L1) as a barrier to learning, as a deficit, and associate shame with their cultural identity (Joffe-Walt, 2020). Again, trauma responses like dissociation, fight, or flight, may be interpreted as behavioral issues, leading to disciplinary actions and further alienation from peers and teachers.</p>\n<h5>BIPOC Students</h5>\n<p>Racism and oppression place tremendous burdens on children in and beyond the classroom. As Georgetown University law professor Charles R. Lawrence III (2006) elucidates, “Not only do we teach children in different schools, separated by race, class, and how much money we spend; we also teach them differently. We offer different content, we speak to them differently, and we listen differently, too. We have different expectations, aspirations, and goals. We are educating them for different futures. We send them different messages about their value to us, to the world, and to themselves” (pp. 712-713). This impacts Black American students in the United States, particularly. In a study of stereotype threat, Black children underperformed white children on tests when they are preceded with racial stereotyping (though their knowledge levels were equal) (Steele, 1997). Other implications are even more insidious and operate implicitly. Racial stereotyping, racism, and oppression create ongoing trauma for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) which lead to higher levels of anxiety and stress, physical illness and mental illness, such as structural dissociation (Menzies, 2019).</p>\n<h4>Reframing Undesirable Behavior</h4>\n<p>Understanding behavior through the lens of trauma illuminates the neurobiological functio",

This includes not only genes known to be associated to the action under study but also those whose association is less expected or their biochemical properties still unknown. Both classes of interactions can now be effectively mapped at a large scale by following two complementary strategies.</p>\n<p>The first one relies on the progress of experimental tools to produce genetic perturbations in large numbers and to automatically quantify their effects (<a href=\"#evu255-B2\">Baryshnikova et al. 2013</a>, growth being typically the primary phenotypic readout but see, for instance, <a href=\"#evu255-B18\">Jonikas et al. 2009</a>). These tools are now providing initial genetic landscapes of cells (e.g., <a href=\"#evu255-B28\">Roguev et al. 2008</a>; <a href=\"#evu255-B7\">Costanzo et al. 2010</a>). A second approach benefits from the advance of computational methods capable to predict phenotypes. Metabolic flux balance models are particularly useful in this regard, as they incorporate genomic information (of metabolism) into an in silico framework that can estimate cell growth under specific conditions (<a href=\"#evu255-B27\">Reed et al. 2006</a>). Notably, flux balance predictions have been confirmed experimentally (e.g., <a href=\"#evu255-B31\">Snitkin et al. 2008</a>). Single mutant fitness and their corresponding genetic interactions can also be produced in this framework (<a href=\"#evu255-B33\">Szappanos et al. 2011</a>).</p>\n<p>These strategies are currently being combined to better interpret the molecular underpinnings of genetic interactions (i.e., epistasis), both negative and positive. Negative epistasis (observed when the fitness defect of a double mutant is lower than that expected from single mutant values) indicates redundancy that can reveal as functional associations between some pathways and/or complexes (e.g., the presence of negative epistasis between the urmylation pathway and the elongator complex in yeast suggested that both jointly modify certain transfer RNAs, <a href=\"#evu255-B7\">Costanzo et al. 2010</a>) or as the buffering of alternative metabolic routes (e.g., leading to the synthesis of the same component, <a href=\"#evu255-B24\">Papp et al. 2004</a>). Positive genetic interactions, in contrast, are commonly observed between genes that constitute a multiprotein complex or metabolic pathway, that is, genes being part of the same functional unit (<a href=\"#evu255-B32\">St Onge et al. 2007</a>): A mutation in one of its constituents can inactivate this unit what reduces the effect of other perturbations in additional components.</p>\n<p>Large-scale approaches lead as well to the identification of system-level patterns, when the interactions are represented as genetic networks. For instance, the network presentation of high-throughput data of <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> and <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> clearly identified the presence of genetic hubs that are mostly associated to chromatin regulation (<a href=\"#evu255-B21\">Lehner et al. 2006</a>; <a href=\"#evu255-B7\">Costanzo et al. 2010</a>). Another feature, revealed for the first time with flux balance modeling, is monochromaticity; the specific distribution of epistasis types in the interactions within/between functional modules (<a href=\"#evu255-B30\">Segrè et al. 2005</a>). This characteristic was later confirmed by metabolic experiments (<a href=\"#evu255-B33\">Szappanos et al. 2011</a>) and high-throughput data (<a href=\"#evu255-B7\">Costanzo et al. 2010</a>), in which a specific distribution of epistasis strengths was additionally identified (<a href=\"#evu255-B25\">Poyatos 2011</a>).</p>\n<p>All previous properties implicitly suggest a stable architecture of genetic networks, a view that was partially influenced by the constant conditions in which interactions were examined. However, recent studies are emphasizing that this stability should not be necessarily the case. Genetic interactions and, more broadly, genetic networks were shown to change depending on the particular context where fitness is evaluated (<a href=\"#evu255-B36\">You and Yin 2002</a>; <a href=\"#evu255-B16\">Harrison et al. 2007</a>; <a href=\"#evu255-B32\">St Onge et al. 2007</a>; <a href=\"#evu255-B1\">Bandyopadhyay et al. 2010</a>; <a href=\"#evu255-B15\">Guénolé et al. 2013</a>). Rewiring is further confirmed by means of comparative analysis across organisms (<a href=\"#evu255-B9\">Dixon et al. 2008</a>; <a href=\"#evu255-B28\">Roguev et al. 2008</a>; <a href=\"#evu255-B11\">Frost et al. 2012</a>; <a href=\"#evu255-B29\">Ryan et al. 2012</a>). Moreover, the “instability” of these networks should not come as a surprise; earlier works already discussed the influence of context (environmental and genetic) on the phenotypic effect of mutations and their interactions (e.g., <a href=\"#evu255-B4\">Chandler et al. 2013</a>; <a href=\"#evu255-B5\">Chari and Dworkin 2013</a>), a phenomenon that can directly influence evolutionary dynamics (<a href=\"#evu255-B14\">Greenspan 2009</a>; <a href=\"#evu255-B6\">Chou et al. 2011</a>; <a href=\"#evu255-B20\">Khan et al. 2011</a>). To what extent genetic networks are context dependent is nevertheless mostly unknown.</p>\n<p>Here, we ask how the structure of a genetic network reorganizes in response to changes in gene background. To this aim, we mapped genetic interactions between metabolic genes by using a computational model of metabolism in <em>S</em><em>. cerevisiae</em>. The advantage of this approach (beyond avoiding experimental complexity) is that it enables the interpretation of the phenotype (i.e., fitness) as an univocal consequence of the structure of the metabolic reaction network underneath. We consider two broad (genetic) background classes. The first class corresponds to single gene deletions of each of the enzymes that are active (i.e., showed nonzero flux) in wild-type (WT) conditions. We characterized which type of backgrounds originate stronger network change and in which kind of interactions this variation is more pronounced. The rewiring patterns found stress the different organization of biosynthetic and catabolic routes and how this impacts their capacity to compensate change. A second class presents neutral backgrounds that are generated by a trajectory of accumulated neutral mutations. This helps us to appreciate how cryptic variability modifies buffering in genetic networks and how the new network structures associate to differential environmental plasticity. We additionally corroborate some of these patterns with inspection of experimental data.</p></section><section><h2>Materials and Methods</h2>\n<section><h3>Genotypes and Simulations</h3>\n<p>We considered the iND750 genome-scale model as the WT genotype (<a href=\"#evu255-B10\">Duarte et al. 2004</a>).

In synthetic biology, there have been several efforts devoted for (1) the standardization of DNA modules and (2) the standardization of functional DNA annotations. To standardize DNA modules, “DNA brick” systems have been proposed in which DNA fragments are sandwiched by a limited set of compatible restriction enzyme (RE) digestion sites such that these modular DNA parts can be reused in different DNA assemblies by ligation<sup><a href=\"#ref-CR12\">12</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR13\">13</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR14\">14</a>,<a href=\"/articles/s41467-022-30588-x#ref-CR15\">15</a></sup>. Such a system would accelerate the DNA construction process when a sufficient amount of modular parts are available. (They have yet to be widely used by the community, probably because the number of compatible parts have yet to meet the diverse demands in biology, or because PCR-based fragment preparation and highly specific overlap DNA assembly methods<sup><a href=\"#ref-CR16\">16</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR17\">17</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR18\">18</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR19\">19</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR20\">20</a>,<a href=\"/articles/s41467-022-30588-x#ref-CR21\">21</a></sup> have become the mainstream and freed molecular cloning from RE-based techniques.) The synthetic biology open language (SBOL)<sup><a href=\"/articles/s41467-022-30588-x#ref-CR22\">22</a></sup> has been proposed to provide functional annotation of gene circuits encoded in DNA sequences. SBOL enables users to define genetic parts and their functional wiring diagrams like electronic circuits in a computer readable format, consequently allowing the design of sequences that confer specific functions through simulating different circuits.</p><p>While the DNA brick systems and SBOL have contributed to the efficient collection of highly modular DNA resources and the systematic annotation of functional DNA resources, respectively, they focus on the standardization of input and output DNA materials. The third key angle to advance new DNA construction with rapidly accumulating DNA resources would be the development of a standardized “process ontology” or “protocol language” to describe DNA construction processes. We envision an efficient DNA design and construction system, whereby the most optimal construction protocol of a target DNA is autonomously formulated with a combination of maximal use of existing DNA materials and knowledge on how previous DNA materials have been practically constructed. We are, however, one step away from establishing such a system. Most of us have still been designing DNA manually with GUI software tools, and the protocols have been described in natural language.</p><p>There are three major challenges to realize a process ontology of DNA construction that is widely accepted by the life science community. First, a standardized framework needs to be developed to universally frame any types of changes in DNA sequences with various types of annotations. While the methods to build and alter DNA materials have been diversifying, such as we are seeing with genome editing technologies<sup><a href=\"/articles/s41467-022-30588-x#ref-CR23\">23</a></sup>, the current DNA editing software tools cannot assist users in incorporating new methods or allow them to develop new plugins. Second, there needs to be an innovative way to motivate the community without substantial costs. Third, such a process ontology would require another system to evaluate the reproducibility and completeness of protocols, which also needs to be accepted by the community. Accompanying these three challenges, a system that globally traces the inheritance of previously established DNA material and protocol resources would be largely beneficial to measure the impacts of previous resources and to credit their developers.</p><p>A quine in computer science is a program that replicates a copy of itself without the need for any inputs. The intriguing concept of quine, which first appeared in the mid-twentieth century<sup><a href=\"/articles/s41467-022-30588-x#ref-CR24\">24</a></sup>, provides us fruitful thoughts on self-replicating machines and their potentials. In this study, inspired by this concept, we developed a simple, versatile framework called QUEEN (a framework to generate “quinable” and efficiently editable nucleotide sequence resources) that resolves all the above-mentioned challenges and enables efficient description, sharing, and crediting of DNA materials and building protocols<sup><a href=\"/articles/s41467-022-30588-x#ref-CR25\">25</a></sup>. QUEEN is a Python package where step-by-step building processes of DNA and their dynamic sequence changes can be freely described and simulated. QUEEN-generated DNA products can be output in the GenBank (gbk) file format that is widely used to describe annotated DNA maps. Due to its flexible file format, QUEEN-generated gbk files achieve several unique features. First, they can regenerate the quine codes that generated themselves using QUEEN (Fig. <a href=\"/articles/s41467-022-30588-x#Fig1\">1a</a>). Just like the research community has already been doing, DNA materials can be deposited to a DNA repository service together with their gbk files created by QUEEN (Fig. <a href=\"/articles/s41467-022-30588-x#Fig1\">1b</a>). While it serves as a regular gbk file, the file’s construction process information can also be recovered by QUEEN, where the reproducibility of the protocol is certified by this clonability. Second, in designing a new DNA construct using QUEEN, when DNA parts are taken from existing QUEEN-generated gbk files (Fig. <a href=\"/articles/s41467-022-30588-x#Fig1\">1c</a>) or a protocol generated from a QUEEN-generated gbk file is modified (Fig. <a href=\"/articles/s41467-022-30588-x#Fig1\">1d</a>), the newly produced gbk file inherits the parental material information as well as their building process histories. This feature will be a backbone for establishing new ways of evaluating genetic resources, protocols, and developers based on how they are inherited in the community (Fig. <a href=\"/articles/s41467-022-30588-x#Fig1\">1e</a>). QUEEN-generated gbk files can easily be spread through the existing databases and DNA repository services as they can be treated as regular gbk files by existing tools. This feature will prime the promotion of the new material and protocol sharing model.</p><div><figure><figcaption><b>Fig. 1: QUEEN.</b></figcaption><div><div><a href=\"/articles/s41467-022-30588-x/figures/1\"></a></div><p><b>a</b> QUEEN enables the generation of a quine code from a gbk file. <b>b</b> A QUEEN-generated gbk file can be deposited to an existing DNA repository as a regular gbk file. <b>c</b> When DNA sequences are partially or fully inherited from previous QUEEN-generated gbk files to build a new DNA, the producing gbk file can contain all the production histories of the ancestral gbk files. <b>d</b> When a QUEEN script obtained from a previously established gbk file is modified to design the building process of a new DNA, such a history is also inherited by the produced gbk file. <b>e</b> A QUEEN-generated gbk file traces its previously utilized DNA materials and protocols, enabling the assessment of community impact of each DNA resource or developer.</p></div><p><a href=\"/articles/s41467-022-30588-x/figures/1\">Full size image</a></p></figure></div></div></div><div><h2>Results</h2><div><h3>Queen</h3><p>QUEEN is a Python module.

In this sense, the aim of this research is to study the relation between theory of mind in children and referential communication. Specifically, our purpose is to study which ToM skills are more related to different communicative behaviours (such as making clarification requests) and strategies that occur in referential communication. We also intend to find out which ToM skills and communicative behaviours or strategies are the most relevant in explaining success in a referential communication cooperative task.</p>\n<section><h3>Development of Referential Communication Skills</h3>\n<p>Referential communication skills refer to the capacity to transmit verbally to a conversational partner the representation of an object, event or idea that constitutes the benchmark for a message (San Martín et al. <a href=\"#CR45\">2014</a>). These skills are important for social adaptation. For example, social interaction problems may arise when children have difficulty in verbalizing inadequate messages (Abbeduto and Short-Meyerson <a href=\"#CR1\">2002</a>; Abbeduto et al. <a href=\"#CR2\">2008</a>). The ability to communicate with others begins to develop very early, but the ability to select the most appropriate expressions in each situation continues to improve until adolescence (Matthews et al. <a href=\"#CR30\">2012</a>). In the specific case of referential communication, it seems to be quite developed around the age of six years, and continues to improve until at least the age of 10 (Pynte et al. <a href=\"#CR37\">1991</a>).</p>\n<p>One of the key skills for successful referential communication is to detect the ambiguity of messages. This requires not only understanding what is communicated linguistically, but also to integrate this information with the state of knowledge of the receiver as well as with the communicative context (Nilsen and Graham <a href=\"#CR33\">2012</a>). Messages cannot be deemed to be appropriate or inappropriate by themselves, but conversational partners need to understand each other within a particular context. For example, over-specifying information about the referent may be a good way to facilitate the identification of the referent (Arts et al. <a href=\"#CR4\">2011</a>). We will now focus on the skills that are important for referential communication, from the viewpoint of both the speaker and the listener.</p>\n<section><h4>Referential Communication Skills of the Speaker</h4>\n<p>Liszkowski et al. (<a href=\"#CR27\">2008</a>) found that, at the age of 12 months, when children communicate with their parents, they are capable of pointing adequately to objects depending on the parent’s prior knowledge about the referent. Once they have acquired language, they also adapt it to the conversational partner. For example, 3-year-old children can modify their speech according to whether their conversational partner can see a referent or not (Campbell et al. <a href=\"#CR10\">2000</a>). In a similar vein, from the age of 2 children already provide appropriate information when they are asked to clarify an ambiguous message, and they may learn from clarification requests (Matthews et al. <a href=\"#CR29\">2007</a>). Furthermore, a child’s capacity to learn from clarification requests seems to be higher when clarification requests are specific rather than general, and when the speaker provides information about the cause of their not understanding (Matthews et al. <a href=\"#CR30\">2012</a>).</p>\n<p>Nilsen and Graham (<a href=\"#CR33\">2012</a>) pointed out that one essential aspect of communication capacity relies on the appreciation of communicative ambiguity. As early as in primary school, children may reformulate their messages without the need to receive clarification requests, so they are aware of the potential ambiguity their messages may have for receivers. In a similar way, Nilsen and Graham (<a href=\"#CR33\">2012</a>) observed that 5-year-old children were aware that a message produced by another person could be ambiguous from the viewpoint of the receiver, without even knowing what the right information was. In this respect, from the age of 6 years, children start producing linguistic expressions more appropriate to the viewpoint of the listener, producing sentences that contain enough information to avoid ambiguity (Nilsen and Fecica <a href=\"#CR32\">2011</a>). However, despite their early capacity for realizing that messages may be ambiguous, children aged from 5 to 7 years still have problems giving helpful information so their conversational partner can solve ambiguities, even when the receiver acknowledges that the referent has not been understood (Karabenick and Miller <a href=\"#CR20\">1977</a>). In fact, one of the difficulties that referential communication represents for children is perceiving which characteristics of a given referent are the most relevant for communicative acts, or what distinguishes one referent from the others.</p></section><section><h4>Referential Communication Skills of the Receiver</h4>\n<p>Children aged from 4 to 6 years have not yet acquired the ability to assess the ‘informativeness’ of a message (Roby and Kidd <a href=\"#CR43\">2008</a>). In addition, 5–6 year-olds still have difficulty in distinguishing what a speaker says literally from what the speaker intends to communicate, and it is difficult for them to realize that ambiguous messages may lead to a state of knowledge different from what the speaker had intended (Beal and Belgrad <a href=\"#CR8\">1990</a>). However, they do have the capacity to differentiate between ambiguous and informative messages if, for example, they are told that the speaker might want to trick them (John et al. <a href=\"#CR18\">2009</a>). Besides, it seems that school-age children tend to overestimate their own knowledge when interpreting ambiguous messages (Nilsen and Graham <a href=\"#CR33\">2012</a>).</p>\n<p>One of the important skills for understanding messages is informing the speaker about the non-comprehension of the message (Skwerer et al. <a href=\"#CR49\">2013</a>), as well as the ability to make clarification requests regarding ambiguous messages, an ability that develops with age (Jeanes et al. <a href=\"#CR17\">2000</a>). However, in relation to the ability to make clarification requests, Skwerer et al. found that it was more important to consider the types of requests rather than their quantity. In summary, it is not until 8 or 9 years of age that children acquire a level of proficiency as receivers almost equal to that of adults (John et al. <a href=\"#CR18\">2009</a>).</p></section></section><section><h3>ToM and Referential Communication Skills</h3>\n<p>By ToM we refer to the capacity to make inferences on our own and others’ mental states (such as, beliefs, desires or intentions), as well as to predict people’s behaviour based on those inferences. ToM is therefore a fundamental capacity that develops gradually from birth, and it is a crucial cognitive development that has been studied intensively in recent years. It may also be understood as a set of skills with different degrees of complexity that appear throughout development and expand our understanding of human behaviour (Serrat et al. <a href=\"#CR47\">2013</a>). Several authors have studied the development of ToM in children, finding that, despite individual differences in relation to when these abilities are acquired, typically-developing children follow a similar developmental pattern, so the order of acquisition of these skills seems to be relatively stable (Wellman et al. <a href=\"#CR50\">2011</a>).</p>\n<p>ToM skills enable us to manage situations of social competence (Byrne and Whiten <a href=\"#CR9\">1988</a>) because they allow us to understand deception, lies or false beliefs about reality; and in humans they enable communication and cooperation with others (Moll and Tomasello <a href=\"#CR31\">2007</a>). Although many of the studies about ToM have placed special emphasis on deception or Machiavellianism, it is appropriate to stress the importance of ToM skills for the cooperative mind. Indeed, people with low-level mentalistic skills are not prone to collaborating with others or engaging in altruistic behaviour, just as they have difficulty in understanding other people’s deceptions or simulating behaviour (Liebal et al. <a href=\"#CR26\">2008</a>; Sally and Hill <a href=\"#CR44\">2005</a>).</p>\n<p>In order to communicate efficiently, people must bear in mind the interlocutor’s viewpoint (John et al. <a href=\"#CR18\">2009</a>). Using it as a guide for our communicative behaviour is an essential component for the capacity to use and interpret appropriately the language used in social interactions. The",

They stressed that population-based studies, including members of diverse communities, were needed to develop the understanding and technologies to reach this level [<a href=\"#ref1\">1</a>]. However, minoritized communities experience many barriers to participating in medical research, which are amplified by aspects of working with genomic data [<a href=\"#ref2\">2</a>,<a href=\"#ref3\">3</a>].</p>\n<p>Mistrust, based on historical memories of abuse and marginalization, creates skepticism about the purpose of research studies as well as a fear that scientists will ignore the individual rights and needs of research participants in their pursuit to further the goals of science [<a href=\"#ref4\">4</a>–<a href=\"#ref6\">6</a>]. The distrust of both research and the medical community opens concerns of mistreatment in terms of research benefitting one race over another with people of color being left out [<a href=\"#ref7\">7</a>–<a href=\"#ref9\">9</a>] as well as concerns that protections for confidentiality and the privacy of medical information are not respected [<a href=\"#ref3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#ref5\">5</a>,<a href=\"#ref10\">10</a>].</p>\n<p>Fear of the misuse of genetic information adds another set of barriers to research participation from historically marginalized groups. For some community members, DNA-related studies open up the participant and their relatives to investigation if law enforcement agencies gain access to the research samples [<a href=\"#ref3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#ref7\">7</a>]. A related concern is the possibility of genetic discrimination by employers and insurance companies if privacy and confidentiality are not maintained [<a href=\"#ref3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#ref5\">5</a>,<a href=\"#ref7\">7</a>]. Many community members believe that signing an informed consent form causes a loss of individual rights [<a href=\"#ref7\">7</a>]. A lack of a common language to bridge the gap between research teams and community members contributes to the fear and misconceptions about genetic research [<a href=\"#ref3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#ref11\">11</a>].</p>\n<p>Community engagement provides principles and values for addressing the barriers to minority participation in genomics research. It focuses on building relationships between academic investigators and community members to develop bidirectional communication yielding increased investigator understanding of the community context, experiences, and concerns, while also expanding community understanding of research processes, terminology, and protections to promote more trust and confidence in medical research [<a href=\"#ref4\">4</a>,<a href=\"#ref12\">12</a>–<a href=\"#ref14\">14</a>]. It creates a pathway to improve research studies through the sharing of research procedures and materials, exploring how those may cause confusion, and working with community partners to edit materials and processes to improve communication with possible research participants [<a href=\"#ref15\">15</a>]. Likewise, the informed consent process can be strengthened in ways that build knowledge about genomics research and equip community members to make more confident decisions about study participation [<a href=\"#ref11\">11</a>,<a href=\"#ref14\">14</a>]. By improving study design and tools, community engagement offers opportunities for increasing diverse participation in genome-related research, while also improving dissemination and translation of findings into impactful interventions [<a href=\"#ref4\">4</a>,<a href=\"#ref13\">13</a>].</p>\n<p>Community Advisory Boards (CABs) represent one mechanism for establishing the desired community-investigator dialog. CABs consist of individuals representing communities that meet regularly with research teams to discuss study protocols and activities [<a href=\"#ref13\">13</a>]. They bring the community voice to research ventures by providing insights into community culture and interests, advocacy for the rights and needs of historically marginalized communities, and local expertise on the development of more accessible study materials [<a href=\"#ref8\">8</a>,<a href=\"#ref12\">12</a>,<a href=\"#ref15\">15</a>]. Through their partnership, CAB members and investigators can develop a deep respect for each other, an understanding of the needs of each, and a focus on ensuring that research will benefit those from groups experiencing disadvantages and not just academic goals [<a href=\"#ref7\">7</a>,<a href=\"#ref16\">16</a>].</p>\n<p>In this article, we describe the experience and outcomes of a community engagement team (CE Team) and CAB partnering to develop recruitment processes for a DNA integrity study implemented in a primarily African American community. We share lessons and practices that helped operationalize recruitment and enrollment for the study. The recruitment and implementation of the CAB as well as all procedures for participant recruitment and data collection for the DNA integrity study were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of South Alabama (USA).</p></section><section><h2>Materials and Methods</h2>\n<section><h3>CE Team</h3>\n<p>The DNA integrity study involved a partnership between a genomic science lab and a community-engaged health equity research center operating within USA’s Health System and College of Medicine, respectively. The three-member CE Team was responsible for implementing community informed recruitment and retention of study participants, as well as data collection. The Lab Team performed all DNA integrity measures on lymphocytes isolated from blood samples provided by the participants [<a href=\"#ref17\">17</a>]. The CE Team has a long history of community-engaged work, comprising research, health advocacy, and promotion of diversity within the health sciences [<a href=\"#ref18\">18</a>–<a href=\"#ref23\">23</a>].</p></section><section><h3>Study Sample</h3>\n<p>The source population (<em>n</em> = 115,633) were residents of 11 zip codes comprising communities whose members are underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR) [<a href=\"#ref24\">24</a>]. Following a snowball sampling design [<a href=\"#ref25\">25</a>,<a href=\"#ref26\">26</a>], the CE Team initially invited members of an UBR cohort who had previously participated in a four-year project to document progression of health equity in the study area. We were able to contact 51 (44.7 %) former cohort participants. Those who decided to participate in the DNA Integrity study (<em>n</em> = 19) were asked to refer relatives or friends the CE Team could reach to provide information about the study and invite for participation. Many of the persons referred were residents in areas beyond the initial zip codes. We eventually expanded the residence inclusion criteria to encompass 20 zip codes. Based on lab processes considerations, the sample size for the study was set at 240 participants.</p></section><section><h3>CAB Description</h3>\n<p>The CAB consisted of eight women and two men of African American descent recruited from various groups working with the CE Team, all of them stakeholders within the communities comprising the initial source population: five CAB members are Community Health Advocates [<a href=\"#ref21\">21</a>,<a href=\"#ref22\">22</a>] (two retired nurses, a community activist, and a social worker), all of whom have organized community health events for several years. The remaining five members comprised the CEO of a community-based organization focused on community health and development, two community members, ",

They bring the community voice to research ventures by providing insights into community culture and interests, advocacy for the rights and needs of historically marginalized communities, and local expertise on the development of more accessible study materials [<a href=\"#ref8\">8</a>,<a href=\"#ref12\">12</a>,<a href=\"#ref15\">15</a>]. Through their partnership, CAB members and investigators can develop a deep respect for each other, an understanding of the needs of each, and a focus on ensuring that research will benefit those from groups experiencing disadvantages and not just academic goals [<a href=\"#ref7\">7</a>,<a href=\"#ref16\">16</a>].</p>\n<p>In this article, we describe the experience and outcomes of a community engagement team (CE Team) and CAB partnering to develop recruitment processes for a DNA integrity study implemented in a primarily African American community. We share lessons and practices that helped operationalize recruitment and enrollment for the study. The recruitment and implementation of the CAB as well as all procedures for participant recruitment and data collection for the DNA integrity study were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of South Alabama (USA).</p></section><section><h2>Materials and Methods</h2>\n<section><h3>CE Team</h3>\n<p>The DNA integrity study involved a partnership between a genomic science lab and a community-engaged health equity research center operating within USA’s Health System and College of Medicine, respectively. The three-member CE Team was responsible for implementing community informed recruitment and retention of study participants, as well as data collection. The Lab Team performed all DNA integrity measures on lymphocytes isolated from blood samples provided by the participants [<a href=\"#ref17\">17</a>].

Following a snowball sampling design [<a href=\"#ref25\">25</a>,<a href=\"#ref26\">26</a>], the CE Team initially invited members of an UBR cohort who had previously participated in a four-year project to document progression of health equity in the study area. We were able to contact 51 (44.7 %) former cohort participants. Those who decided to participate in the DNA Integrity study (<em>n</em> = 19) were asked to refer relatives or friends the CE Team could reach to provide information about the study and invite for participation. Many of the persons referred were residents in areas beyond the initial zip codes. We eventually expanded the residence inclusion criteria to encompass 20 zip codes. Based on lab processes considerations, the sample size for the study was set at 240 participants.</p></section><section><h3>CAB Description</h3>\n<p>The CAB consisted of eight women and two men of African American descent recruited from various groups working with the CE Team, all of them stakeholders within the communities comprising the initial source population: five CAB members are Community Health Advocates [<a href=\"#ref21\">21</a>,<a href=\"#ref22\">22</a>] (two retired nurses, a community activist, and a social worker), all of whom have organized community health events for several years.

The DNA of learning\nmetaphor details effective pedagogical practices and encourages instructors to\ntake a more challenging and possibly transformative approach to their course\ndesign and classroom experiences.\nOrganization Management Journal (2008) 5, 167–179. doi:10.1057/omj.2008.16\nKeywords: management teaching; effective outcomes; learning\nIntroduction\nThere are elements of learning that are readily measured: a\ndefinition, a ratio, some historical fact or even a brief recitation\nof a theory (note, e.g., resource-based theory or issues pertaining to\nagency). Evaluation and synthesis of these facts and concepts in\nscenarios, as occurs in management classes, can move the learner\nfrom simply recalling information to increasingly complex think\u0002ing. For example, a case study could have the student apply\nmultiple theories and concepts to analyze an issue in a complex\nand dynamic situation.\nMeaningful learning must be more than recalling a definition or\ncalculating a ratio. Business professionals of the future must be\ncapable of performing multilayered and multilevel analyses to\nunderstand complex, interrelated issues that can impact on the\nenvironment, societal, and business spheres, as well as on the\npersonal spheres of their own lives. What then does meaningful\nlearning look like in the classroom?\nMeaningful learning situates facts and theories within context,\nseeks to understand their import, and provides guidance for future\naction within a complex and changing environment. Meaningful\nlearning involves ‘‘the process whereby knowledge is created\nthrough the transformation of experience’’ (Kolb, 1984: 38).\nOrganization Management Journal (2008) 5, 167–179\n& 2008 Eastern Academy of Management All rights reserved 1541-6518\nTherefore, meaningful learning connects with and\nbuilds upon students’ funds of knowledge: that is,\ntheir socio-cultural and personal experience (Moll,\n1992). Furthermore, if we accept that learning is the\nprocess of creating knowledge then knowledge is\nthe result of the transaction between the person,\nthe content and the context. It involves ‘‘reading\nthe world’’ (Friere, 1982) and absorbing and apply\u0002ing curriculum content to real world contexts,\nissues, and problems (Atwater et al., 2008). Kolb\n(1984, see also literary theorist, Rosenblatt, 1978)\nconsciously names the word transact as opposed to\ninteract to capture the ‘‘more fluid interpenetrating\nrelationship between objective conditions and\nsubjective experience, such that once they become\nrelated both are essentially changed’’ (p. 36).\nMeaningful learning is, therefore, potentially trans\u0002formative and most often occurs when knowledge\nlearned through experience combines with knowl\u0002edge frames learned through content (Vygotsky’s\nnotion of spontaneous and scientific concepts,\n1984: 194). Classroom activities can activate both\nspontaneous and scientific concept formation,\nwhich in turn can provide meaningful learning\nexperiences where content knowledge and experi\u0002ence are applied.\nIt is our intention in this paper to explore the\nnotion of meaningful learning and to examine one\nclassroom context in which meaningful learning\noccurs: an undergraduate capstone strategic man\u0002agement class. To facilitate this understanding we\nuse a metaphor borrowed from the model of DNA\nreplication to represent the process of creating\nmeaningful learning. We call this the ‘‘DNA of\nmeaningful learning’’ with the intention of focus\u0002ing on the transformative potential of the learning\nexperience. In the following sections, we will\nexplain this approach to meaningful learning,\ndescribe an exercise that exemplifies several of the\ndesired learning states and outcomes, and elaborate\nfurther on the structure of meaningful learning\noffered in this paper. One objective is to provide a\nmemorable metaphor, which would highlight the\ntransformative and generative nature of a mean\u0002ingful learning experience.\nThe DNA of meaningful learning\nThe double helix structure of DNA is an elegant\nfigure, that is, deceptively simple in form but very\ncomplex in function, much the same as good\nteaching. In simple terms, DNA replication is the\nprocess by which the genetically encoded informa\u0002tion within its structure is duplicated. During this\nprocess, one strand of DNA detaches from its\ndouble helix structure and pairs with matching\nbut opposite bases. In this way, an identical copy is\nmade of the opposite strands. While in theory the\nreplicated strand should be identical, variation does\nhappen. In sexual reproduction, DNA from the\nmale and female recombine to make new complete\nbut slightly different strands of DNA. The advan\u0002tage of sexual reproduction is in the controlled\nvariation of characteristics within systemic ranges\nthus height, weight, speed, even complex traits\nsuch as intelligence are effected by the matching of\nthe DNA strands to the proper site on the partner\nstrand.\nLikewise, when students enter a course, whether\nthey are freshmen or graduate students, they bring\nwith them their personal, social, and content\n‘‘funds of knowledge’’ through which they inter\u0002pret course work to make sense of what is heard\nand experienced. In terms of our metaphor,\nthey have their own ‘‘knowledge DNA’’ that they\nbring with them. Instructors’ funds of knowledge\ninclude course content knowledge and life experi\u0002ences; instructors select their own strand of\n‘‘knowledge DNA’’ that they intend to share with\nthese students through the course experience.\nThe classroom context affords multiple opportu\u0002nities and formats to share information and\ngenerate knowledge as information combines\nwith content and experience for students to\nfurther their understanding of the subject being\ntaught. However, not all instruction allows for\nstudents to combine what they know with the\ncontent being shared and to actively construct new\nknowledge.\nMeaningful instruction can happen in the class\u0002room or online or in any intentional setting that\nthe instructor determines to be appropriate for the\ngeneration of a particular ‘‘strand of DNA.’’ The\nchosen ‘‘classroom’’ is then the institutional site for\nthe co-construction of new knowledge DNA. Too\noften, because courses are not designed to facilitate\na knowledge exchange, the two strands of ‘‘knowl\u0002edge DNA’’ fail to recombine in transformative and\nmeaningful ways. Moreover, if a course is not\ndesigned with multiple opportunities for engaged\nstudent learning that taps into the student’s unique\n‘‘knowledge DNA,’’ then the transformative poten\u0002tial of that course will not be activated, or possibly\never achieved.\nThe DNA metaphor reminds us that we have to\ndesign course experiences that facilitate knowledge\nexchange and new knowledge formation by\nMeaningful learning in management David Saiia et al.\n168\nOrganization Management Journal\nattempting to elicit, nurture, and promote higher\norder thinking skills in our students. Such knowl\u0002edge exchange and formation are likely to occur in\nan environment that (1) offers current, explicitly\nrelevant content, and experiences (Friere, 1982)\nand (2) values, acknowledges, builds upon, and\nmakes socially significant, student contributions\n(Kolb, 1984; Bloome et al., 2005). In such an\nenvironment, management knowledge is con\u0002structed and reconstructed using personal experi\u0002ences in an integrative relationship between faculty\nand students that values both the existential and\nessential components of knowledge (Atwater et al.,\n2008). The goal of this process is to produce\npotentially transformative classroom experiences\nfor both the students and the instructors.\nThe DNA metaphor as applied here may be novel,\nbut the ideas and theory that underpin this\nconceptualization are not. Scholars of management\nand of educational theory have long talked about\nvalidating stakeholder input and acknowledging\nthe available funds of knowledge within a consti\u0002tuency (Freeman, 1984). In Teaching as a Subversive\nActivity (1969), authors Postman and Weingartner\nidentified ‘‘outdated canons’’ of education. Most\nimportantly, they noted the need to move beyond\nthe idea that one and only one right answer exists.\nThus, the logical completion of that thought is that\nabsolute answers cannot be absolutely right. Indi\u0002vidual viewpoints and situational factors must be\nhonored. Students should understand that the\noutcomes of business and society problems, for\nexample, are the product o",

For example, a case study could have the student apply\nmultiple theories and concepts to analyze an issue in a complex\nand dynamic situation.\nMeaningful learning must be more than recalling a definition or\ncalculating a ratio. Business professionals of the future must be\ncapable of performing multilayered and multilevel analyses to\nunderstand complex, interrelated issues that can impact on the\nenvironment, societal, and business spheres, as well as on the\npersonal spheres of their own lives. What then does meaningful\nlearning look like in the classroom?\nMeaningful learning situates facts and theories within context,\nseeks to understand their import, and provides guidance for future\naction within a complex and changing environment. Meaningful\nlearning involves ‘‘the process whereby knowledge is created\nthrough the transformation of experience’’ (Kolb, 1984: 38).\nOrganization Management Journal (2008) 5, 167–179\n& 2008 Eastern Academy of Management All rights reserved 1541-6518\nTherefore, meaningful learning connects with and\nbuilds upon students’ funds of knowledge: that is,\ntheir socio-cultural and personal experience (Moll,\n1992). Furthermore, if we accept that learning is the\nprocess of creating knowledge then knowledge is\nthe result of the transaction between the person,\nthe content and the context. It involves ‘‘reading\nthe world’’ (Friere, 1982) and absorbing and apply\u0002ing curriculum content to real world contexts,\nissues, and problems (Atwater et al., 2008). Kolb\n(1984, see also literary theorist, Rosenblatt, 1978)\nconsciously names the word transact as opposed to\ninteract to capture the ‘‘more fluid interpenetrating\nrelationship between objective conditions and\nsubjective experience, such that once they become\nrelated both are essentially changed’’ (p. 36).\nMeaningful learning is, therefore, potentially trans\u0002formative and most often occurs when knowledge\nlearned through experience combines with knowl\u0002edge frames learned through content (Vygotsky’s\nnotion of spontaneous and scientific concepts,\n1984: 194). Classroom activities can activate both\nspontaneous and scientific concept formation,\nwhich in turn can provide meaningful learning\nexperiences where content knowledge and experi\u0002ence are applied.\nIt is our intention in this paper to explore the\nnotion of meaningful learning and to examine one\nclassroom context in which meaningful learning\noccurs: an undergraduate capstone strategic man\u0002agement class. To facilitate this understanding we\nuse a metaphor borrowed from the model of DNA\nreplication to represent the process of creating\nmeaningful learning. We call this the ‘‘DNA of\nmeaningful learning’’ with the intention of focus\u0002ing on the transformative potential of the learning\nexperience. In the following sections, we will\nexplain this approach to meaningful learning,\ndescribe an exercise that exemplifies several of the\ndesired learning states and outcomes, and elaborate\nfurther on the structure of meaningful learning\noffered in this paper. One objective is to provide a\nmemorable metaphor, which would highlight the\ntransformative and generative nature of a mean\u0002ingful learning experience.\nThe DNA of meaningful learning\nThe double helix structure of DNA is an elegant\nfigure, that is, deceptively simple in form but very\ncomplex in function, much the same as good\nteaching. In simple terms, DNA replication is the\nprocess by which the genetically encoded informa\u0002tion within its structure is duplicated. During this\nprocess, one strand of DNA detaches from its\ndouble helix structure and pairs with matching\nbut opposite bases. In this way, an identical copy is\nmade of the opposite strands. While in theory the\nreplicated strand should be identical, variation does\nhappen. In sexual reproduction, DNA from the\nmale and female recombine to make new complete\nbut slightly different strands of DNA. The advan\u0002tage of sexual reproduction is in the controlled\nvariation of characteristics within systemic ranges\nthus height, weight, speed, even complex traits\nsuch as intelligence are effected by the matching of\nthe DNA strands to the proper site on the partner\nstrand.\nLikewise, when students enter a course, whether\nthey are freshmen or graduate students, they bring\nwith them their personal, social, and content\n‘‘funds of knowledge’’ through which they inter\u0002pret course work to make sense of what is heard\nand experienced. In terms of our metaphor,\nthey have their own ‘‘knowledge DNA’’ that they\nbring with them. Instructors’ funds of knowledge\ninclude course content knowledge and life experi\u0002ences; instructors select their own strand of\n‘‘knowledge DNA’’ that they intend to share with\nthese students through the course experience.\nThe classroom context affords multiple opportu\u0002nities and formats to share information and\ngenerate knowledge as information combines\nwith content and experience for students to\nfurther their understanding of the subject being\ntaught. However, not all instruction allows for\nstudents to combine what they know with the\ncontent being shared and to actively construct new\nknowledge.\nMeaningful instruction can happen in the class\u0002room or online or in any intentional setting that\nthe instructor determines to be appropriate for the\ngeneration of a particular ‘‘strand of DNA.’’ The\nchosen ‘‘classroom’’ is then the institutional site for\nthe co-construction of new knowledge DNA. Too\noften, because courses are not designed to facilitate\na knowledge exchange, the two strands of ‘‘knowl\u0002edge DNA’’ fail to recombine in transformative and\nmeaningful ways. Moreover, if a course is not\ndesigned with multiple opportunities for engaged\nstudent learning that taps into the student’s unique\n‘‘knowledge DNA,’’ then the transformative poten\u0002tial of that course will not be activated, or possibly\never achieved.\nThe DNA metaphor reminds us that we have to\ndesign course experiences that facilitate knowledge\nexchange and new knowledge formation by\nMeaningful learning in management David Saiia et al.\n168\nOrganization Management Journal\nattempting to elicit, nurture, and promote higher\norder thinking skills in our students. Such knowl\u0002edge exchange and formation are likely to occur in\nan environment that (1) offers current, explicitly\nrelevant content, and experiences (Friere, 1982)\nand (2) values, acknowledges, builds upon, and\nmakes socially significant, student contributions\n(Kolb, 1984; Bloome et al., 2005). In such an\nenvironment, management knowledge is con\u0002structed and reconstructed using personal experi\u0002ences in an integrative relationship between faculty\nand students that values both the existential and\nessential components of knowledge (Atwater et al.,\n2008). The goal of this process is to produce\npotentially transformative classroom experiences\nfor both the students and the instructors.\nThe DNA metaphor as applied here may be novel,\nbut the ideas and theory that underpin this\nconceptualization are not. Scholars of management\nand of educational theory have long talked about\nvalidating stakeholder input and acknowledging\nthe available funds of knowledge within a consti\u0002tuency (Freeman, 1984). In Teaching as a Subversive\nActivity (1969), authors Postman and Weingartner\nidentified ‘‘outdated canons’’ of education. Most\nimportantly, they noted the need to move beyond\nthe idea that one and only one right answer exists.\nThus, the logical completion of that thought is that\nabsolute answers cannot be absolutely right. Indi\u0002vidual viewpoints and situational factors must be\nhonored. Students should understand that the\noutcomes of business and society problems, for\nexample, are the product o",

Yet, little is known about knowledge construction processes among health professions students working together to care for patients. Understanding knowledge construction processes can guide health professions educators in the design of interventions to support knowledge construction and high-quality learning in clinical placements. In this article, we describe findings from a proof of concept study that explores the feasibility and utility of using Gunawardena's Interaction Analysis Model (IAM) to evaluate health professions students' knowledge construction processes in clinical placements. The IAM has been used to study knowledge construction processes in computer-supported collaborative learning environments, but not in interprofessional education. The IAM describes five phases of knowledge construction - sharing/comparing; exploring dissonance; co-constructing meaning; testing; coming to agreement/applying co-constructed knowledge - each representing a progressively higher-level learning process. Application of the IAM to learner dialogue proved labor-intensive but feasible and useful as a research tool to characterize learners' knowledge construction behaviors. Our findings suggest that the IAM warrants further study and may offer a framework to guide the design of clinical placements and analysis of interprofessional learning behaviors.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nKeywords:\n</strong>\nClinical learning environment; health professions education; interaction analysis; interprofessional; knowledge construction; qualitative.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/disclaimer/\">PubMed Disclaimer</a>\n</p>\n<div>\n<h2>\nSimilar articles\n</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32226076/\">\nA Mobile Learning Module to Support Interprofessional Knowledge Construction in the Health Professions.\n</a></p><p><span>Floren LC, Mandal J, Dall'Era M, Shin J, Irby DM, Cate OT, O'Brien BC.</span>\n<span>Floren LC, et al.</span>\n<span>Am J Pharm Educ. 2020 Feb;84(2):847519. doi: 10.5688/ajpe847519.</span>\n<span>Am J Pharm Educ. 2020.</span>\n<span>PMID: <span>32226076</span></span>\n<span>Free PMC article.</span>\n</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35686997/\">\nPreliminary evidence for a Tool to Observe the Construction of Knowledge in Interprofessional teams (TOCK-IP).\n</a></p><p><span>Carstensen Floren L, Louise Pittenger A, Ten Cate O, M Irby D.</span>\n<span>Carstensen Floren L, et al.</span>\n<span>J Interprof Care. 2023 May-Jun;37(3):410-417. doi: 10.1080/13561820.2022.2070143.

Yet, little is known about knowledge construction processes among health professions students working together to care for patients. Understanding knowledge construction processes can guide health professions educators in the design of interventions to support knowledge construction and high-quality learning in clinical placements. In this article, we describe findings from a proof of concept study that explores the feasibility and utility of using Gunawardena's Interaction Analysis Model (IAM) to evaluate health professions students' knowledge construction processes in clinical placements. The IAM has been used to study knowledge construction processes in computer-supported collaborative learning environments, but not in interprofessional education. The IAM describes five phases of knowledge construction - sharing/comparing; exploring dissonance; co-constructing meaning; testing; coming to agreement/applying co-constructed knowledge - each representing a progressively higher-level learning process. Application of the IAM to learner dialogue proved labor-intensive but feasible and useful as a research tool to characterize learners' knowledge construction behaviors. Our findings suggest that the IAM warrants further study and may offer a framework to guide the design of clinical placements and analysis of interprofessional learning behaviors.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nKeywords:\n</strong>\nClinical learning environment; health professions education; interaction analysis; interprofessional; knowledge construction; qualitative.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/disclaimer/\">PubMed Disclaimer</a>\n</p>\n<div>\n<h2>\nSimilar articles\n</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32226076/\">\nA Mobile Learning Module to Support Interprofessional Knowledge Construction in the Health Professions.\n</a></p><p><span>Floren LC, Mandal J, Dall'Era M, Shin J, Irby DM, Cate OT, O'Brien BC.</span>\n<span>Floren LC, et al.</span>\n<span>Am J Pharm Educ. 2020 Feb;84(2):847519. doi: 10.5688/ajpe847519.</span>\n<span>Am J Pharm Educ. 2020.</span>\n<span>PMID: <span>32226076</span></span>\n<span>Free PMC article.</span>\n</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35686997/\">\nPreliminary evidence for a Tool to Observe the Construction of Knowledge in Interprofessional teams (TOCK-IP).\n</a></p><p><span>Carstensen Floren L, Louise Pittenger A, Ten Cate O, M Irby D.</span>\n<span>Carstensen Floren L, et al.</span>\n<span>J Interprof Care. 2023 May-Jun;37(3):410-417. doi: 10.1080/13561820.2022.2070143.

Casen representerer fire klasser på samme skole, som i løpet av studien går fra første til andre trinn. Studien er basert på teori om samkonstruksjon (Mercer &amp; Howe, 2012). Det ble gjennomført fire dager med observasjon i de fire klasserommene. De første observasjonene viste at samtalene var preget av at lærere stilte lukkede spørsmål med påfølgende evalueringer av elevenes svar. Observasjonene ble etterfulgt av et seminar for lærerne og forskerne der hensikten var å etablere en felles forståelse av samkonstruksjon i klasserommet. Etter seminaret avdekket observasjonene en viss endring i lærernes kommunikasjon med elever i temabasert undervisning. Lærerne stilte mer åpne spørsmål, fulgte opp elevenes svar og inviterte dem til å konstruere innhold sammen med lærer og hverandre i undervisningen. Casestudien viser at temabasert undervisning bidro til at lærerne stilte mer åpne og inviterende spørsmål og at elevene deltok mer i helklassesamtalene. Lærerne åpnet i større grad for samkonstruksjon, sammenlignet med deres undervisning i grunnleggende lese-, skrive- og matematikkopplæring. ENGLISH ABSTRACT Teachers’ Facilitation of Co-construction in Whole-Class Communication This case study explores the co-construction of knowledge in whole-class communication in four Norwegian primary classes, going from year one to two. The study is based on theories of co-construction (Mercer &amp; Howe, 2012). Four days of observation were carried out in four classrooms. Initial observations showed class communication characterized by the teachers’ use of closed questions and the evaluation of responses to pupils’ answers. Subsequently, a seminar was held between the teachers and researchers to establish a joint understanding of how to promote co-construction in the classroom. Further observations revealed some changes in the teachers’ communication practices with pupils in theme-based teaching. In theme-based teaching, the teachers asked more open-ended questions and followed up on the pupils’ answers, inviting them to co-construct content in further communication. The findings showed that themebased teaching contributed to more active participation and, to a greater extent, opened opportunities for co- construction compared to traditional teaching of reading, writing, and mathematical skills.</span></p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>... 100 Table 11: Examples of message components that contributed to the classification of having low, medium or high relational presence (RP), adapted from (Burgoon &amp; Hale, 1984). 101 Table 12: Examples of verbs that are used to describe the communicative action or interaction.. 102 Table 13: General alignment of GitHub actions with (Damşa et al., 2010) and <mark>Damşa &amp; Ludvigsen (2016)</mark> schema. ...</p></div><div><p>...

Research on effective pedagogical and technical design for computer supported collaborative learning in higher education (CSCL) has often taken place in synchronous contexts, using specialised technology platforms. However, large-scale changes to work and education resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic necessitate the development of pedagogical and research approaches that support students working asynchronously, in distributed teams, using collaboration platforms that extend beyond institutional infrastructure.\nWithin the field of CSCL, knowledge building research has shown collaboration to be a complex systems phenomenon, involving the intersection of individual and collective efforts to actively advance the group’s shared knowledge, but studies analysing interaction data have been resource-intensive to conduct. Contemporary workplace platforms such as professional knowledge environments have multiple design affordances consistent with knowledge building principles, as well as the capacity to generate rich data about user activity. However, we have little understanding to date as to how these environments can support knowledge building pedagogies and facilitate associated research.\nThis study uses a case study approach and thematic analysis to investigate the activity of three university groups engaged in a collaborative modelling task over time. It investigates how agency emerges during project work in professional knowledge environments, and how the system interaction data can extend our understanding of effective collaboration processes. The results show that the GitHub platform can support knowledge building pedagogical designs in facilitating individual and collective agency in higher education group work, and provide insights into epistemic, regulative and relational aspects of learner behaviour at individual and group levels.\nThese findings extend our understanding of effective learning design to novel environments of a type likely to be used by our students in the workplace, and make design and methodological contributions to research on computer-supported collaborative learning.</span></p></div></div></div><div><div><p>...

Educational research has offered </p><p>a range of methods to stimulate rich encoding in order to improve students' learning (Sadoski </p><p>&amp; Paivio, 2001). Teachers are specifically encouraged to modify learning materials to 'best </p><p>fit' each student’s strengths, weaknesses, and interests (Dockterman, 2018; Gutiérrez &amp; </p><p>Slavin, 1992; Hartley, 2007; Schworm &amp; Stiller, 2012). Concerns have been raised by critics </p><p>regarding the difficulties associated with adapting materials to align with students' personal </p><p>interests, as it necessitates personalized accommodation and support (Turk et al., 2015). This </p><p>places a significant burden on teachers and may adversely affect their motivation to employ </p><p>such methods. There is a pressing need for a more streamlined and focused approach to </p><p>enhance students' learning outcomes. </p><p>The research in cognitive science has revealed a lot about how individuals process </p><p>and retain knowledge, which provides some important perspectives for current educational </p><p>theory and practice. For instance, studies on memory and learning have shed light on </p><p>effective encoding and retrieval strategies that can optimize students' retention of </p><p>information. Research on the self-reference effect shows that the self is a vital memory </p><p>enhancer (Rogers et al., 1977; Klein &amp; Loftus, 1988<span>; </span>Sui &amp; Humphreys, 2017). Researchers </p><p>have introduced self-referential encoding techniques in education, wherein educators connect </p><p>students' learning materials with self-referencing cues (d'Ailly et al., 1997; Mayer et al., </p><p>2004), such as personal pronouns, self-names, self-owned objects. Several studies have </p><p>shown that modifying learning materials to include self-referencing cues can facilitate the </p><p>learning process (e.g., increase attention, accelerate encoding) to learning materials and </p><p>promote learning outcomes (Cunningham et al., 2018; Mayer et al., 2004; Sinatra et al., </p><p>2016). These studies demonstrate the potential utility of incorporating the self in educational </p></div>\n<div><div><p>Preprint <span></span>Version. <span></span>DOI: <span></span>10.111/bjep.12636.</p></div><p>contexts. Meanwhile, several researchers, such as Kühl and Münzer (2021) and Sinatra et al. </p><p>(2016), have encountered contradictory re<span>sults. Interestingly, the findings from these studies </span></p><p>even suggest an inverted self-referencing effect for learning outcomes. As a result, the </p><p>disparity in research outcomes raises significant questions about the applicability of </p><p>implementing self-referential encoding techniques in education. For example, one crucial </p><p>question is whether self-referential encoding techniques have an overall positive effect on </p><p>learning. Additionally, it is essential to explore situations in which these techniques may not </p><p>be suitable or effective for enhancing learning outcomes. </p><p>To address the crucial questions regarding the effectiveness of applying self-</p><p>refere",

Educational research has offered </p><p>a range of methods to stimulate rich encoding in order to improve students' learning (Sadoski </p><p>&amp; Paivio, 2001). Teachers are specifically encouraged to modify learning materials to 'best </p><p>fit' each student’s strengths, weaknesses, and interests (Dockterman, 2018; Gutiérrez &amp; </p><p>Slavin, 1992; Hartley, 2007; Schworm &amp; Stiller, 2012). Concerns have been raised by critics </p><p>regarding the difficulties associated with adapting materials to align with students' personal </p><p>interests, as it necessitates personalized accommodation and support (Turk et al., 2015). This </p><p>places a significant burden on teachers and may adversely affect their motivation to employ </p><p>such methods. There is a pressing need for a more streamlined and focused approach to </p><p>enhance students' learning outcomes. </p><p>The research in cognitive science has revealed a lot about how individuals process </p><p>and retain knowledge, which provides some important perspectives for current educational </p><p>theory and practice. For instance, studies on memory and learning have shed light on </p><p>effective encoding and retrieval strategies that can optimize students' retention of </p><p>information. Research on the self-reference effect shows that the self is a vital memory </p><p>enhancer (Rogers et al., 1977; Klein &amp; Loftus, 1988<span>; </span>Sui &amp; Humphreys, 2017). Researchers </p><p>have introduced self-referential encoding techniques in education, wherein educators connect </p><p>students' learning materials with self-referencing cues (d'Ailly et al., 1997; Mayer et al., </p><p>2004), such as personal pronouns, self-names, self-owned objects. Several studies have </p><p>shown that modifying learning materials to include self-referencing cues can facilitate the </p><p>learning process (e.g., increase attention, accelerate encoding) to learning materials and </p><p>promote learning outcomes (Cunningham et al., 2018; Mayer et al., 2004; Sinatra et al., </p><p>2016). These studies demonstrate the potential utility of incorporating the self in educational </p></div>\n<div><div><p>Preprint <span></span>Version. <span></span>DOI: <span></span>10.111/bjep.12636.</p></div><p>contexts. Meanwhile, several researchers, such as Kühl and Münzer (2021) and Sinatra et al. </p><p>(2016), have encountered contradictory re<span>sults. Interestingly, the findings from these studies </span></p><p>even suggest an inverted self-referencing effect for learning outcomes. As a result, the </p><p>disparity in research outcomes raises significant questions about the applicability of </p><p>implementing self-referential encoding techniques in education. For example, one crucial </p><p>question is whether self-referential encoding techniques have an overall positive effect on </p><p>learning. Additionally, it is essential to explore situations in which these techniques may not </p><p>be suitable or effective for enhancing learning outcomes. </p><p>To address the crucial questions regarding the effectiveness of applying self-</p><p>refere",

She looked beyond funding issues into the dynamics of contextuality and globally resonant education.</p><div><p>LenkaBula (above) argued that to tackle the notion of an engaged university, the higher education system needs to be assessed for its own validity.</p>\n<p>“Is it enabling for students, staff or those who are in the pursuit of knowledge, as we are often told in transformative impulse for self, family, the community, society but also the global agenda? What criteria are necessary for evaluating impact as well as the engagement?” She referred to criteria integral to transformation and engaged scholarship – that would be evident in the sustainable autonomy of the knowledge systems themselves, but also the organisation of institutions of higher education.</p>\n<p>“How do we deal with issues of gender but also the inclusion of students living with disability as well as those who are in the LGBTQIA community? Are they embraced, or do they see themselves in the curricula that they are learning, or do they see themselves as aliens in the knowledge arena?”</p>\n<p>These were the questions she posed to the audience as the engaged university and transformation discourse takes centre-stage in the sector.</p>\n<p>Moving on, Professor LenkaBula touched on the context of digitalisation — South Africa and its political geospatial and economic location — as a consumer of digital systems and not necessarily an owner. She alerted the audience to the implications of these on The Engaged University.</p>\n<p>“Is the engaged university one in the forefront of constructing knowledge or co-constructing, inventing knowledge, which is shared, developed, optimised in the multiplicity of sectors within society, or is it one which is embroiled with digitalisation systems that it has to buy — which it has no control of in the teaching and learning processes?”</p>\n<p>She also referred to the overwhelming commodifying and disruptive thrust of digitalisation that the sector has had to enforce, particularly in the context of CoViD-19. She referred to the digital systems; online platforms, artificial intelligence, and multiplicities of other educational digital resources that tend to be owned or located within the global north. She was problematising zero ownership of these inventions that place institutions at the mercy of developers with limited knowledge of the South African context.</p>\n<p>“For me, it has become crystal clear that as members of universities epistemic communities, we must be engaged more than ever; but it is also clear that the old order has to give to new paradigms.</p>\n<p>“This is particularly true because whilst the old paradigms may have been just and committed to the public good, the new transformations seem to be at the centre of the commodification of knowledge, including the dependency on the institutional and ICT infrastructures that are not necessarily available for the global south.”</p>\n<p>She borrowed from Antonio Gramsci, a Brazilian scholar, who stated that education is dead if it does not make the principle of justice effective for all and in the plural.</p>\n<p>“The danger is that the weaker sections of society will never see the ability or opportunities of education as that which invites their intellectual agency in contributing to the changes in society within which they live,” she said, calling for a move from being consumers to becoming co-constructors or collaborating in the knowledge arena.</p>\n<p>In particular, she championed the notion of the creative spirit that seeks alternatives to ensure that the educational relationship is not reflected strictly on the scholastic relationship but exists for every individual throughout society.</p>\n<p>Referencing Gramsci again, she said education at all points must be revolutionary, transformative, and enabling of the agency of participants to co-construct futures through their participation as moral agents in the learning arena. LenkaBula said she was of the view that the sector cannot discuss engaged universities and scholarship without understanding colonial throttles over the knowledge systems within the context of African universities or the post-school education system.</p>\n<p>“The idea is never to be subaltern. In the post-colonial discourse, the idea is never to be marginal or to be rendered marginal. It is to claim voice, participation and co-constructing of knowledge, innovation, inventions, civilisation, and ideas that promote dignity; ideas that are humanising. To ensure that knowledge is not limited to a few and that the knowledge systems produced by universities are relevant for the knowledge economy and for transforming societies.”</p>\n<p>In essence, she said an engaged and transformed university is gender-inclusive and gives a platform to people living with disabilities.

What criteria are necessary for evaluating impact as well as the engagement?” She referred to criteria integral to transformation and engaged scholarship – that would be evident in the sustainable autonomy of the knowledge systems themselves, but also the organisation of institutions of higher education.</p>\n<p>“How do we deal with issues of gender but also the inclusion of students living with disability as well as those who are in the LGBTQIA community? Are they embraced, or do they see themselves in the curricula that they are learning, or do they see themselves as aliens in the knowledge arena?”</p>\n<p>These were the questions she posed to the audience as the engaged university and transformation discourse takes centre-stage in the sector.</p>\n<p>Moving on, Professor LenkaBula touched on the context of digitalisation — South Africa and its political geospatial and economic location — as a consumer of digital systems and not necessarily an owner. She alerted the audience to the implications of these on The Engaged University.</p>\n<p>“Is the engaged university one in the forefront of constructing knowledge or co-constructing, inventing knowledge, which is shared, developed, optimised in the multiplicity of sectors within society, or is it one which is embroiled with digitalisation systems that it has to buy — which it has no control of in the teaching and learning processes?”</p>\n<p>She also referred to the overwhelming commodifying and disruptive thrust of digitalisation that the sector has had to enforce, particularly in the context of CoViD-19. She referred to the digital systems; online platforms, artificial intelligence, and multiplicities of other educational digital resources that tend to be owned or located within the global north. She was problematising zero ownership of these inventions that place institutions at the mercy of developers with limited knowledge of the South African context.</p>\n<p>“For me, it has become crystal clear that as members of universities epistemic communities, we must be engaged more than ever; but it is also clear that the old order has to give to new paradigms.</p>\n<p>“This is particularly true because whilst the old paradigms may have been just and committed to the public good, the new transformations seem to be at the centre of the commodification of knowledge, including the dependency on the institutional and ICT infrastructures that are not necessarily available for the global south.”</p>\n<p>She borrowed from Antonio Gramsci, a Brazilian scholar, who stated that education is dead if it does not make the principle of justice effective for all and in the plural.</p>\n<p>“The danger is that the weaker sections of society will never see the ability or opportunities of education as that which invites their intellectual agency in contributing to the changes in society within which they live,” she said, calling for a move from being consumers to becoming co-constructors or collaborating in the knowledge arena.</p>\n<p>In particular, she championed the notion of the creative spirit that seeks alternatives to ensure that the educational relationship is not reflected strictly on the scholastic relationship but exists for every individual throughout society.</p>\n<p>Referencing Gramsci again, she said education at all points must be revolutionary, transformative, and enabling of the agency of participants to co-construct futures through their participation as moral agents in the learning arena. LenkaBula said she was of the view that the sector cannot discuss engaged universities and scholarship without understanding colonial throttles over the knowledge systems within the context of African universities or the post-school education system.</p>\n<p>“The idea is never to be subaltern. In the post-colonial discourse, the idea is never to be marginal or to be rendered marginal. It is to claim voice, participation and co-constructing of knowledge, innovation, inventions, civilisation, and ideas that promote dignity; ideas that are humanising. To ensure that knowledge is not limited to a few and that the knowledge systems produced by universities are relevant for the knowledge economy and for transforming societies.”</p>\n<p>In essence, she said an engaged and transformed university is gender-inclusive and gives a platform to people living with disabilities. A university that ensures the dialogue between natural sciences and social sciences, their pedagogies not epistemological resonance — make sense and meaning for society.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, she said: “Engaged scholars and engaged universities will not exist if they do not enable and facilitate the pursuit of wisdom as the philosophers tell us; the pursuit for humanising, dignified, inventive environments that allow people to come as they are, to contribute to the knowledge systems, the knowledge arena in the contextual environments within which they exist, whilst as the same time, aspiring to see their knowledge systems finding global footprint.”</p>\n</div><p><em>The writer, Nqobile Tembe, is a Communication Consultant contracted by Universities South Africa.</em></p></div>",
