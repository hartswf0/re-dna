To be able to successfully gather, analyze and transfer\ninformation throughout an organization is one of a Market Intelligence department´s main\npurposes. Decision makers throughout an organization are highly dependent on the quality of the\nMarket Intelligence department´s findings and its communication and interaction activities.\nThe purpose of this thesis is therefore to investigate which critical factors that needs to be taken\ninto consideration when a Market Intelligence department communicates its findings in order to\nfacilitate knowledge transfer for their internal clients.\nA theoretical background regarding communication and knowledge transfer is provided in order to\nunderstand the context of the thesis. The theoretical framework for this study is mainly based on\nSzulanski´s four critical dimensions of knowledge transfer; characteristics of the knowledge\ntransferred, of the source, of the recipient and of the context in which the transfer takes place. In\norder to gather relevant empirical data for this study, Volvo Cars Corporation and its Market\nIntelligence department was contacted. The authors collected the primary data on site at Volvo Cars\nCorporation´s headquarter in Gothenburg, Sweden, during November 2009.\nThe study showed that there are several critical factors, some more important than others, that\nneeds to be taken into consideration in order for a Market Intelligence department to communicate\nits findings in order to facilitate knowledge transfer for their internal clients.\nAn MI department needs to:\n Consider the type of information and knowledge they intend to communicate and adjust its\ncommunication approach accordingly.\n Be involved in their internal clients’ projects.\n Be aware that today’s performance affects tomorrow’s credibility.\n Understand its internal clients’ absorptive skills.\n Schedule enough time for interaction and an oral presentation in the\ncases where it is needed.\n Focus on building a relationship with its internal clients.\nTable of Contents\n1.

Ask the senior executive to serve as the host of the annual face-to-face meeting of the KM community and to attend some of the meeting. Ask senior managers to act as co-hosts of mandatory webinars to train all managers in using tools, setting goals, and delivering messages.</p>\n<p>See also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://lucidea.com/blog/10-guidelines-for-leveraging-push-communication-to-promote-km-initiatives/?_ga=2.115006535.1377746023.1620678374-1051082078.1620678374\">Push Communications</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://lucidea.com/blog/km-success-stories/?_ga=2.115006535.1377746023.1620678374-1051082078.1620678374\"><span>Success Stories</span></a></li>\n</ul></div></div>",

        "text": "<div><div><p>It’s been about 3 years since I first heard of knowledge management. Ever since I came to two conclusions:</p>\n<p><strong>1. the right software, app or structure for knowledge management doesn’t exist and</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. communication is key to keep knowledge „alive“.</strong></p>\n<p>If knowledge is not alive, it’s just information – dead information, that might be good in- formation, but if no one knows about it and no one uses it, it’s not knowledge.</p>\n<p>I first got in contact with knowledge management at an event called „knowledge camp“. At that time I had been working for a company that produces explanatory videos. We de- cided that this event could be interesting for us, because by explaining all kinds of things in short videos the company was definitely providing knowledge. So we went there – and came back with a lot better understanding what knowledge management means and how important it is for a company.</p>\n<p>A growing one for example. When I had started to work at the company, we were 12 people and everybody knew everything about what was going on. Growing more and more we had to figure out how to keep everyone as informed as possible and as ne- cessary. That’s how I started to look more into knowledge management.</p>\n<p><strong>What is knowledge management?</strong></p>\n<p>Due to the fact that knowledge management is a relatively young field and a very dynamic one, there’s not one definition that everyone uses and that I could cite here. So I’ll just continue telling my personal experience and share what my task as the company’s new knowledge manager was: I was looking for the best way to collect and share the know- ledge in our company for daily work as well as for new colleagues.</p>\n<p>How did I start? By asking people what they wanted to know or what they wanted to im- prove regarding this topic. Because as I explained earlier, knowledge has to be alive and it only starts to live through people. That was something I realized quite quickly: Even if I found the perfect software or app, if people didn’t like it, it was useless.</p>\n<p>At the same time I started to work on a „knowledge map“: What knowledge was there in our company, where was it and how was it shared between people at the moment.</p>\n<p><strong>The results: </strong> The knowledge map helped me to visualize the knowledge in our company. There was digital knowledge, knowledge we shared in conversations at lunch or in meetings and knowledge in people’s heads. And as I mentioned before, I also found out that there wasn’t the one perfect knowledge management tool or the one perfect structure for all the information, because every company is different and therefore has different needs towards managing their knowledge.</p>\n<p>But with everything that I found out in the back of my head I could narrow my questions down to two very important ones that I wanted to answer:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What’s the easiest way to find the right information for <strong>people with questions</strong>?</li>\n<li>How can I inform <strong>people without questions</strong> about existing knowledge?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Once I accepted there wasn’t the one tool that I had to find, I focused on finding out what people were already using. How did people with questions find the right information at the moment and how could I support them? One way was definitely by making all our infor- mation searchable. At first I thought about a better structure. But structures are subjective and therefore not self-explaining. Whilst no structure but a strong search engine is – as we all know.</p>\n<p>So all it took was a searchable data base. Well ... not quite. In order to have a good data base we needed to provide two more things: First, everyone had to fill the data base con- stantly to make it grow with us. Second, we had to use a system that showed how old a document was and if there was a newer version of it (by now I know that it’s also useful to know the document owner). The death of our former wiki was caused by exactly that: data that wasn’t up to date. As a person looking for the right information you have to be able to rely on the information you find, otherwise you won’t even start searching the data base the next time.</p>\n<p><strong>I had answered my first question. The second one definitely was more tricky though. </strong>How can you make someone find something when he or she doesn’t even know that they should look for it? I thought back to how it had worked when we used to be a small group of employees. Everyone talked to everyone, so people knew what was going on, what the others were doing or who knew most about certain topics. Maybe just be- cause they heard what their neighbour was talking on the phone before lunch.</p>\n<p><strong>Communication seemed to be the key.</strong> By looking at my knowledge map again, I reali- zed that some departments had no meetings together and they were sitting a three minu- tes walk away from each other – so no chance of overhearing conversations either. And some of the new colleagues who now arrived monthly needed weeks to get to know everyone from other departments.</p>\n<p>My task was clear: Bringing back a useful amount of communication and sharing of knowledge. But first of all I told everyone about the situation, about what we needed to do to improve our knowledge management. Everyone knows something, everyone contri- butes to bringing knowledge to life, so I needed everyone’s help. Luckily my colleagues were awesome. So here’s what we did:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>every week we randomly picked different people out of different departments to have lunch together</li>\n<li>Based on my knowledge map we established meetings in order to share knowledge where there had be none</li>\n<li>Every department chose a person who would especially think about important things that occurred in their department and should be shared with others</li>\n<li>We put a short questionnaire plus photo on the fridge for every new colleague</li>\n<li>One wall in the office became our organization chart with big pictures of everyone, so people could see who’s who at a glance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this was a process that took almost a year. I started to look for Frankenstein’s know- ledge monster and realized that it would be a lot harder to bring it to life than make ever- yone at the company part of a knowledge community and let information sharing live with their everyday work.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you keep knowledge alive in your company?</strong></p>\n</div></div>",

And as I mentioned before, I also found out that there wasn’t the one perfect knowledge management tool or the one perfect structure for all the information, because every company is different and therefore has different needs towards managing their knowledge.</p>\n<p>But with everything that I found out in the back of my head I could narrow my questions down to two very important ones that I wanted to answer:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What’s the easiest way to find the right information for <strong>people with questions</strong>?</li>\n<li>How can I inform <strong>people without questions</strong> about existing knowledge?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Once I accepted there wasn’t the one tool that I had to find, I focused on finding out what people were already using. How did people with questions find the right information at the moment and how could I support them? One way was definitely by making all our infor- mation searchable. At first I thought about a better structure. But structures are subjective and therefore not self-explaining. Whilst no structure but a strong search engine is – as we all know.</p>\n<p>So all it took was a searchable data base. Well ... not quite. In order to have a good data base we needed to provide two more things: First, everyone had to fill the data base con- stantly to make it grow with us. Second, we had to use a system that showed how old a document was and if there was a newer version of it (by now I know that it’s also useful to know the document owner). The death of our former wiki was caused by exactly that: data that wasn’t up to date. As a person looking for the right information you have to be able to rely on the information you find, otherwise you won’t even start searching the data base the next time.</p>\n<p><strong>I had answered my first question. The second one definitely was more tricky though. </strong>How can you make someone find something when he or she doesn’t even know that they should look for it? I thought back to how it had worked when we used to be a small group of employees. Everyone talked to everyone, so people knew what was going on, what the others were doing or who knew most about certain topics. Maybe just be- cause they heard what their neighbour was talking on the phone before lunch.</p>\n<p><strong>Communication seemed to be the key.</strong> By looking at my knowledge map again, I reali- zed that some departments had no meetings together and they were sitting a three minu- tes walk away from each other – so no chance of overhearing conversations either. And some of the new colleagues who now arrived monthly needed weeks to get to know everyone from other departments.</p>\n<p>My task was clear: Bringing back a useful amount of communication and sharing of knowledge. But first of all I told everyone about the situation, about what we needed to do to improve our knowledge management. Everyone knows something, everyone contri- butes to bringing knowledge to life, so I needed everyone’s help. Luckily my colleagues were awesome. So here’s what we did:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>every week we randomly picked different people out of different departments to have lunch together</li>\n<li>Based on my knowledge map we established meetings in order to share knowledge where there had be none</li>\n<li>Every department chose a person who would especially think about important things that occurred in their department and should be shared with others</li>\n<li>We put a short questionnaire plus photo on the fridge for every new colleague</li>\n<li>One wall in the office became our organization chart with big pictures of everyone, so people could see who’s who at a glance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this was a process that took almost a year. I started to look for Frankenstein’s know- ledge monster and realized that it would be a lot harder to bring it to life than make ever- yone at the company part of a knowledge community and let information sharing live with their everyday work.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you keep knowledge alive in your company?</strong></p>\n</div></div>",

In reinforcement learning paradigms, learning rates are inferred from behavioral reports<sup><a href=\"#CR2\">2</a></sup>. Self-reporting, however, is highly sensitive to a variety of contextual factors unrelated to knowledge of the core task demands<sup><a href=\"#CR3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#CR4\">4</a></sup>, potentially confounding the interpretation of behavioral performance. Animal models of learning have gained traction in recent years because they allow more direct links to be established between behavioral performance, computations and algorithms used for learning, and neural implementations of these algorithms<sup><a href=\"#CR5\">5</a></sup>. The ability to monitor the activity of the same neurons over many days using chronic two-photon imaging<sup><a href=\"#CR6\">6</a></sup> and single-unit electrophysiology<sup><a href=\"#CR7\">7</a></sup> has further accelerated the exploration of neural mechanisms of learning. To date, studies focused on acquisition of task knowledge (i.e., learning rate) depend upon measuring expression of that knowledge by an animal’s own self-report. This is true for sensorimotor tasks typically used across sensory modalities<sup><a href=\"#CR6\">6</a>,<a href=\"#CR8\">8</a>–<a href=\"#CR13\">13</a></sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, a key tenant of behavioral and systems neuroscience posits that humans and other animals learn tasks at vastly different rates<sup><a href=\"#CR6\">6</a>,<a href=\"#CR10\">10</a>,<a href=\"#CR14\">14</a>–<a href=\"#CR17\">17</a></sup>. This has led to the idea that inter-animal variability in performance arises from differences in underlying learning rate parameters that impact the rate of task acquisition<sup><a href=\"#CR17\">17</a>–<a href=\"#CR19\">19</a></sup>. While attempts have been made to link learning-related performance variability to various modulatory factors<sup><a href=\"#CR16\">16</a>,<a href=\"#CR20\">20</a></sup>, these approaches mostly focus on the acquisition of task-related contingencies.</p>\n<p>Here, we dissociate the acquisition of underlying stimulus-action associations from context-dependent expression by manipulating the testing context. We introduce a simple behavioral manipulation, removing access to reinforcement (probe context), and then measure behavioral performance in two distinct contexts, one with reinforcement and the other without. Surprisingly, we identify two parallel learning processes, one related to the acquisition of task contingencies (revealed in the probe context) and the other related to the expression of that knowledge (demonstrated in the reinforced context). Across tasks, each animal species performed remarkably better in the probe context during learning and inter-animal variability was strikingly reduced. In the presence of reinforcement, performance trajectories were slower and far more variable between individual animals. As a result, we find that the probe context reveals a learning trajectory that more faithfully describes the acquisition of stimulus-action associations while the reinforced context demonstrates the role of contextual factors in modulating behavioral expression. We capture these results with a network model in which learning occurs during reinforced trials while context modulates only the read-out parameters. Reinforcement feedback is thus critical for learning-related plasticity but simultaneously can mask the expression of underlying knowledge.</p></section><section><h2>Results</h2>\n<section><h3>Expression of knowledge during learning is context-dependent</h3>\n<p>To determine how context affects the behavioral assessment of learning, we first trained mice on an auditory go/no-go stimulus recognition task<sup><a href=\"#CR21\">21</a></sup> (Fig. <a href=\"#Fig1\">1a</a>).

With context-aware computing, we now have the means of considering the situation of use not only in the <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-process\">design process</a>, but in real time while the device is in use. In <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/human-computer-interaction\">Human-Computer Interaction</a> (HCI), we traditionally aim to understand the user and the context of use and create designs that support the major anticipated use cases and situations of use. In Context-Aware Computing on the other hand, making use of context causes a fundamental change: We can support more than one context of use that are equally optimal. At runtime – when the user interacts with the application — the system can decide what the current context of use is and provide a <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ui-design\">user interface</a> specifically optimized for this context. With context-awareness, the job of designing the user interface typically becomes more complex as the number of situations and contexts which the system will be used in usually increases. In contrast to traditional systems, we do not design for a single -or a limited set - of <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/contexts-of-use\">contexts of use</a>; Instead, design for several contexts. The advantage of this approach is that we can provide optimized user interfaces for a range of contexts.</p>\n<p>Let us assume the following example: You are asked to design a user interface for a wrist watch. In your research you find out that people will use it indoors and outdoors, they will use it in the dark as well as in sunlight, they will use it when they run to catch the train as well as when they sit in a lecture and are bored. As a good user interface designer, you end up with many ideas for an exciting user interface for each situation: For example, when the user is running to catch the train, the user interface should show the time highlighting the minutes and seconds in a very large font. On the other hand, when the user is attending a lecture the user interface should show the time in a very small font, and additionally provide a funny quote. In a traditional design process, you would realize – after creating your sketches and design briefs – that you have to decide which one of your ideas for a user interface you want to use. You would realize that supporting all the situations in a single design will not work. The typical result is a compromise – which often loses much of the edge of the ideas you initially came up with. However, if you take the approach of Context-Aware Computing, you could create a context-aware watch, where you combine all your situation-optimized designs in a single design. If you designed your watch so that it could recognize each of the situations that you had found in your initial research (e.g. running to catch the train, attending a lecture, etc), your watch could reconfigure itself based on the recognized context. Figure 2 shows a design <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/sketching\">sketch</a> for a context-aware watch.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Author/Copyright holder: Unknown (pending investigation). Copyright terms and licence: Unknown (pending investigation). See section \"Exceptions\" in the <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/about/terms-of-use\">copyright terms</a> below.</p>\n<p><strong>Figure 14.2</strong>: Design sketches that illustrate ideas for time visualizations in different contexts. Left: for users that run to catch the train; making it easy to see the minutes. Middle: a time visualization for boring lectures and meetings; shows a count down to the end, and some information to engage the user. Right: visualization that gives only a very coarse idea of the time, similar to the information you get from the sun, e.g. for hanging out with friends when time does not matter. With context-awareness, you could create a product that combines all three visualizations and choose the most appropriate one according to the recognized context.</p>\n<p>The example shows the great advantage of context-aware computing systems as the freedom of design is increased, but at the same time systems become more complex and often more difficult to design and implement.

Personal computers were used in office environments or on factory floors. The context of use did not change much, and there was little variance in the situations surrounding the computer. Hence, there was no need to adapt to different environments. Many traditional methods in the discipline of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), such as <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/contextual-interviews\">contextual inquiry</a> or <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/task-analysis\">task analysis</a>, have their origin in this period and are most easy to use in situations that do not constantly change. With the rise of mobile computers and ubiquitous computing, this changed. Users take computers with them and use them in many different situations, see Figure 4.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/mobile-computing\">mobile computing</a> era, in the late 80s and 90s, the central theme was how to make mobility transparent for the user, automatically providing the same service everywhere. Here, transparent meant that the user did not have to care about changes in the environment and could rely on the same functionality independent of the environment.</p>\n<p>In the early 90s, research into ubiquitous computing at Xerox PARC caused a shift in thinking. In addition to making functionality transparent, such as providing network connectivity throughout a campus without the user realizing the hand-over between different networks, researchers discovered the potential to exploit the context of use as a resource to which systems can be adapted. In his 1994 paper at the Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (WMCSA), Bill Schilit introduces the concept of context-aware computing and describes it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><div><p>Such context-aware software adapts according to the location of use, the collection of nearby people, hosts, and <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/accessibility\">accessible</a> devices, as well as to changes to such things over time. A system with these capabilities can examine the computing environment and react to changes to the environment. </p><p>-- Schilit et al 1994</p></div>\n</blockquote><p>The basic ideas is that mobile devices can provide different services in different contexts – where context is strongly related to the location of a device.</p>\n<p>Much of the initial research of context-aware computing hence focused on <em>location-aware</em> systems. In this sense, the widely-used satellite navigation systems in cars today are context-aware systems. However, context is more than location, as we argue in (Schmidt et al 1999) and throughout this chapter.<br/></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Author/Copyright holder: Courtesy of Library of Virginia.

For each yes-no question , we let and be the natural language statements where we answer as “Yes” and “No” respectively.\nAnswering the question then amounts to determining which of or is true.\nWe compute probabilities and that and are true respectively using a learned mapping from the hidden states to a number between and .\nWe search for a mapping such that that the probabilities are both confident and consistent.\nOn the right, we show a histogram of the “Yes” probabilities, , learned by our method on the unlabeled train split of the COPA dataset <cite>(Roemmele et al., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2212.03827v2#bib.bib43\">2011</a>)</cite> with the UnifiedQA model <cite>(Khashabi et al., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2212.03827v2#bib.bib21\">2020</a>)</cite>.\nOur method uses no labels and no model outputs, but still learns to accurately answers questions.\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>We propose a different approach for addressing this misalignment: using models to answer questions in a purely <span>unsupervised</span> way.\nIntuitively, instead of trying to explicitly, externally specify truth, we search for implicit, internal “beliefs” or “knowledge” learned by a model.\nWe approach this problem by leveraging the fact that a model’s representation of truth must satisfy logical consistency properties, which are unlikely to be satisfied by many other features.</p>\n<p>We implement this idea by introducing Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS), a method that learns a linear projection of the hidden states that is consistent across negations, as illustrated in Figure <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2212.03827v2#S1.F1\"><span>1</span></a>.\nWe find that despite its simplicity and despite not having access to any labels or model outputs, CCS can accurately recover knowledge from model representations: evaluated across 6 models and 10 question-answering datasets, CCS outperforms the accuracy of strong zero-shot baselines by 4% on average (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2212.03827v2#S3.SS2.SSS1\"><span>Section</span> <span>3.2.1</span></a>).\nThe resulting classifier is also less sensitive to different prompts than zero-shot, cutting the standard deviation in accuracy in half.\nAdditionally, we try deliberately prompting models to make incorrect outputs, which should intuitively change what models say but which shouldn’t affect their latent knowledge.\nWe find that this causes zero-shot accuracy to drop by up to 9.5% (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2212.03827v2#S3.SS2.SSS2\"><span>Section</span> <span>3.2.2</span></a>) without decreasing the accuracy of CCS.</p>\n<p>We systematically analyze CCS to understand the features it discovers.\nWe show that it transfers across unrelated tasks, suggesting that models may have a task-agnostic representation of the truth and that CCS is able to approximately discover it (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2212.03827v2#S3.SS3.SSS1\"><span>Section</span> <span>3.3.1</span></a>).\nMoreover, CCS sometimes works best using the hidden states in the <span>middle</span> layers of a network and can work even when model outputs aren’t very informative, suggesting that it can leverage different features from those used by the outputs (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2212.03827v2#S3.SS3.SSS2\"><span>Section</span> <span>3.3.2</span></a>).\nFinally, we show that representations of truth tend to be salient in models: they can often be found without much data, and they can often be found by taking the top principal component of a slightly modified representation space (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2212.03827v2#S3.SS3.SSS3\"><span>Section</span> <span>3.3.3</span></a>).</p>\n<p>Most existing techniques for making models truthful use human supervision to explicitly specify what is correct.\nHowever, it is not feasible to provide supervision in some settings.\nOur work serves as a proof of concept that an external source of ground truth may not actually be necessary: we may instead be able to find a model’s latent representation of truth, independent of what a model says, without using any supervision in the first place.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>\n<span>2 </span>Problem Statement and Framework</h2>\n<p>In this section we describe our problem setup in more detail and introduce Contrast-Consistent Search

we can also use the labels “positive” and “negative” for sentiment classification.\nMoreover, our setup can easily extend to the case where we want to evaluate the truth of a set of statements instead of answering a set of questions.\n</span></span></span>, our goal is to answer each correctly.\nHere, can be any question with a well-defined answer, including procedural questions like “Is 22+59 = 237?”, for which the answer is “No”, and factual questions like “Are cats mammals?”, for which the answer is “Yes”.</p>\n<p>Importantly, we want methods that do not rely on the model generating correct outputs and that do not rely on external supervision.\nInstead, we turn to the model’s unlabeled hidden representations.\nSpecifically, let denote some feature representation on a natural

instead of trying to explicitly, externally specify truth, we search for implicit, internal “beliefs” or “knowledge” learned by a model.\nWe approach this problem by leveraging the fact that a model’s representation of truth must satisfy logical consistency properties, which are unlikely to be satisfied by many other features.</p>\n<p>We implement this idea by introducing Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS), a method that learns a linear projection of the hidden states that is consistent across negations, as illustrated in Figure <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2212.03827v2#S1.F1\"><span>1</span></a>.\nWe find that despite its simplicity and despite not having access to any labels or model outputs, CCS can accurately recover knowledge from model representations: evaluated across 6 models and 10 question-answering datasets, CCS outperforms the accuracy of strong zero-shot baselines by 4% on average (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2212.03827v2#S3.SS2.SSS1\"><span>Section</span> <span>3.2.1</span></a>).\nThe resulting classifier is also less sensitive to different prompts than zero-shot, cutting the standard deviation in accuracy in half.\nAdditionally, we try deliberately prompting models to make incorrect outputs, which should intuitively change what models say but which shouldn’t affect their latent knowledge.\nWe find that this causes zero-shot accuracy to drop by up to 9.5% (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2212.03827v2#S3.SS2.SSS2\"><span>Section</span> <span>3.2.2</span></a>) without decreasing the accuracy of CCS.</p>\n<p>We systematically analyze CCS to understand the features it discovers.\nWe show that it transfers across unrelated tasks, suggesting that models may have a task-agnostic representation of the truth and that CCS is able to approximately discover it (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2212.03827v2#S3.SS3.SSS1\"><span>Section</span> <span>3.3.1</span></a>).\nMoreover, CCS sometimes works best using the hidden states in the <span>middle</span> layers of a network and can work even when model outputs aren’t very informative, suggesting that it can leverage different features from those used by the outputs (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2212.03827v2#S3.SS3.SSS2\"><span>Section</span> <span>3.3.2</span></a>).\nFinally, we show that representations of truth tend to be salient in models: they can often be found without much data, and they can often be found by taking the top principal component of a slightly modified representation space (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2212.03827v2#S3.SS3.SSS3\"><span>Section</span> <span>3.3.3</span></a>).</p>\n<p>Most existing techniques for making models truthful use human supervision to explicitly specify what is correct.\nHowever, it is not feasible to provide supervision in some settings.\nOur work serves as a proof of concept that an external source of ground truth may not actually be necessary: we may instead be able to find a model’s latent representation of truth, independent of what a model says, without using any supervision in the first

Virtual Reality (VR) demonstrated its potential to help, by immersing users into either simulated virtual crowds\nbased on autonomous agents, or within motion-capture-based crowds. In the latter case, users’ own captured motion can be used\nto progressively extend the size of the crowd, a paradigm called Record-and-Replay (2R). However, both approaches demonstrated\nseveral limitations which impact the quality of the acquired crowd data. In this paper, we propose the new concept of contextual\ncrowds to leverage both crowd simulation and the 2R paradigm towards more consistent crowd data. We evaluate two different\nstrategies to implement it, namely a Replace-Record-Replay (3R) paradigm where users are initially immersed into a simulated crowd\nwhose agents are successively replaced by the user’s captured-data, and a Replace-Record-Replay-Responsive (4R) paradigm where\nthe pre-recorded agents are additionally endowed with responsive capabilities. These two paradigms are evaluated through two\nreal-world-based scenarios replicated in VR. Our results suggest that the behaviors observed in VR users with surrounding agents\nfrom the beginning of the recording process are made much more natural, enabling 3R or 4R paradigms to improve the consistency of\ncaptured crowd datasets.\nIndex Terms—Crowd Simulation, Human Interaction, Virtual Reality\n1 INTRODUCTION\nCrowd motion data plays a critical role in understanding and modeling\ncrowd dynamics and local pedestrian behaviors. While comprehen\u0002sive datasets that include body movements, eye gaze direction, and\nhand gestures would be valuable, most of the existing crowd datasets\nprimarily document pedestrian positional data, due to technological\nconstraints [22]. However, with the emergence of data-driven crowd\nmodeling approaches, the need for rich and large datasets is paramount.\nAs traditional approaches struggle to find a good compromise between\ndata reconstruction and time-money cost efficiency, Virtual Reality\n(VR) has recently been explored as a data collection tool [3, 8, 48].\nIndeed, performing data acquisition in an immersive virtual environ-\n• Tairan Yin, Ludovic Hoyet, Marc Christie, and Julien Pettré are with Inria,\nUniv Rennes, CNRS, IRISA, France.

For information on\nobtaining reprints of this article, please send e-mail to: reprints@ieee.org.\nDigital Object Identifier: xx.xxxx/TVCG.201x.xxxxxxx\nment allows for improved scene control and repeatability, a wider range\nof acquired modalities, as well as more efficient data processing with\nguaranteed synchronization.\nHowever, applying VR-based motion capture to crowds is extremely\nchallenging. Let us describe the two alternative strategies that have\nbeen explored so far, and explain why each of them has partially failed.\nThe first strategy is to immerse the captured participant in a simulated,\nvirtual crowd, consisting of autonomous – and therefore reactive –\nagents (e.g., [10, 44]). This approach has proven to be very appropriate\nfor closely observing the reaction of one (at a time) individual to a\ngiven situation within a crowd. Repeating the same experiment with\nnumerous participants allows obtaining various possible responses to\nthe same situation, and to understand the average behavior. Let us\nstress that this first strategy is however not applicable for recording\nfull crowd datasets (i.e., the behavior of multiple participants at once),\nsince everything but the VR user is simulated. The second strategy\nalleviates the above limitation by enabling users to create a full crowd\ndataset on their own, thanks to an iterative process enabling them to\nrecord successive trajectories (e.g., [67]). The final dataset thus consists\nentirely of captured data. Unfortunately, the successive iterations may\nalter the realism of the users’ behavior, since they start recording in an\nempty scene and react only to their own previously recorded data.\n1\nTherefore, the objective of this work is to propose and validate a new\nparadigm for creating fully VR-based crowd datasets that are consistent\nwith natural behavior. To achieve this, the insight is to combine the two\napproaches described above, namely – to always expose subjects to\na realistic surrounding crowd, but also to allow them to compose a\ncomplete crowd dataset where the final data results only from the actual\nactions of a participant. To this end, we build on the recent idea of\nrecording a crowd dataset through an iterative process [67] – which we\ncall here a Record-and-Replay (2R) process – and extend this process\nby immersing participants in contextual crowds, defined as numerous\ncharacters (agents) that provide participants with realistic surroundings\nfrom the beginning.\nSpecifically, we propose two versions of this new paradigm:\nReplace-Record-Replay (3R), where, instead of an empty scene as in\n2R, users move among a contextual crowd and progressively replace,\none at a time, each of its virtual agents; Replace-Record-Replay\u0002Responsive (4R) where, extending 3R, a motion correction strategy is\nadded to agents by locally editing their motion when the user is close.\nThis makes user-recorded characters responsive, e.g., by enabling them\nto show collision avoidance behaviors. Our exploration of these two\nparadigms leads to the understanding of: (1) the effect of being im\u0002mersed in a contextual crowd on the user’s behavior during the crowd\ngeneration process, and (2) the effect of having responsive characters\ndeviate from their original trajectories on the user’s behavior, which\nindeed impacts the quality of the generated crowd data. The exploration\nof these effects relies on behavioral metrics to compare the properties\nof trajectories recorded using different paradigms, or with real data.\nOur contributions are threefold:\n1. We introduce the concept of contextual crowds to combine the\nadvantages of immersion in a simulated crowd with those of\nRecord-and-Replay methods, towards consistent crowd motion\ncapture in VR. We propose two alternative setups (3R and 4R),\nand compare their results on two well-studied crowd scenarios.\n2. Using the 3R paradigm, we validate the use of contextual crowds\nto induce interactions during the crowd generation procedure. We\nfurther demonstrate that simulated contexts have similar effects\nas reusing real contexts.\n3. Using the 4R paradigm, we demonstrate that the use of locally\nresponsive agents improves the quality of user collision avoidance,\nat the cost of locally deviating from user-captured-only data.\nAfter discussing related work in Section 2, we introduce the key con\u0002cepts in Section 3, and detail our experiments in Section 4. In Section 5\nwe present our analysis methodology, and discuss the corresponding re\u0002sults in Section 6. We finally discuss our method and the main findings\nin Section 7, before concluding.\n2 RELATED WORK\nIn this section, we explore the connections between crowd data, crowd\ncapture in VR and crowd simulation, and position our work in the\ncontext of modern VR-based crowd dataset capture.\n2.1 Human Crowd Datasets\nHuman crowd datasets are of paramount importance in understand\u0002ing [22], predicting [1, 65] and modeling [68] crowd behavior.

Virtual Reality (VR) demonstrated its potential to help, by immersing users into either simulated virtual crowds\nbased on autonomous agents, or within motion-capture-based crowds. In the latter case, users’ own captured motion can be used\nto progressively extend the size of the crowd, a paradigm called Record-and-Replay (2R). However, both approaches demonstrated\nseveral limitations which impact the quality of the acquired crowd data. In this paper, we propose the new concept of contextual\ncrowds to leverage both crowd simulation and the 2R paradigm towards more consistent crowd data. We evaluate two different\nstrategies to implement it, namely a Replace-Record-Replay (3R) paradigm where users are initially immersed into a simulated crowd\nwhose agents are successively replaced by the user’s captured-data, and a Replace-Record-Replay-Responsive (4R) paradigm where\nthe pre-recorded agents are additionally endowed with responsive capabilities. These two paradigms are evaluated through two\nreal-world-based scenarios replicated in VR. Our results suggest that the behaviors observed in VR users with surrounding agents\nfrom the beginning of the recording process are made much more natural, enabling 3R or 4R paradigms to improve the consistency of\ncaptured crowd datasets.\nIndex Terms—Crowd Simulation, Human Interaction, Virtual Reality\n1 INTRODUCTION\nCrowd motion data plays a critical role in understanding and modeling\ncrowd dynamics and local pedestrian behaviors. While comprehen\u0002sive datasets that include body movements, eye gaze direction, and\nhand gestures would be valuable, most of the existing crowd datasets\nprimarily document pedestrian positional data, due to technological\nconstraints [22]. However, with the emergence of data-driven crowd\nmodeling approaches, the need for rich and large datasets is paramount.\nAs traditional approaches struggle to find a good compromise between\ndata reconstruction and time-money cost efficiency, Virtual Reality\n(VR) has recently been explored as a data collection tool [3, 8, 48].\nIndeed, performing data acquisition in an immersive virtual environ-\n• Tairan Yin, Ludovic Hoyet, Marc Christie, and Julien Pettré are with Inria,\nUniv Rennes, CNRS, IRISA, France.

Let us describe the two alternative strategies that have\nbeen explored so far, and explain why each of them has partially failed.\nThe first strategy is to immerse the captured participant in a simulated,\nvirtual crowd, consisting of autonomous – and therefore reactive –\nagents (e.g., [10, 44]). This approach has proven to be very appropriate\nfor closely observing the reaction of one (at a time) individual to a\ngiven situation within a crowd. Repeating the same experiment with\nnumerous participants allows obtaining various possible responses to\nthe same situation, and to understand the average behavior. Let us\nstress that this first strategy is however not applicable for recording\nfull crowd datasets (i.e., the behavior of multiple participants at once),\nsince everything but the VR user is simulated. The second strategy\nalleviates the above limitation by enabling users to create a full crowd\ndataset on their own, thanks to an iterative process enabling them to\nrecord successive trajectories (e.g., [67]). The final dataset thus consists\nentirely of captured data. Unfortunately, the successive iterations may\nalter the realism of the users’ behavior, since they start recording in an\nempty scene and react only to their own previously recorded data.\n1\nTherefore, the objective of this work is to propose and validate a new\nparadigm for creating fully VR-based crowd datasets that are consistent\nwith natural behavior. To achieve this, the insight is to combine the two\napproaches described above, namely – to always expose subjects to\na realistic surrounding crowd, but also to allow them to compose a\ncomplete crowd dataset where the final data results only from the actual\nactions of a participant. To this end, we build on the recent idea of\nrecording a crowd dataset through an iterative process [67] – which we\ncall here a Record-and-Replay (2R) process – and extend this process\nby immersing participants in contextual crowds, defined as numerous\ncharacters (agents) that provide participants with realistic surroundings\nfrom the beginning.\nSpecifically, we propose two versions of this new paradigm:\nReplace-Record-Replay (3R), where, instead of an empty scene as in\n2R, users move among a contextual crowd and progressively replace,\none at a time, each of its virtual agents; Replace-Record-Replay\u0002Responsive (4R) where, extending 3R, a motion correction strategy is\nadded to agents by locally editing their motion when the user is close.\nThis makes user-recorded characters responsive, e.g., by enabling them\nto show collision avoidance behaviors. Our exploration of these two\nparadigms leads to the understanding of: (1) the effect of being im\u0002mersed in a contextual crowd on the user’s behavior during the crowd\ngeneration process, and (2) the effect of having responsive characters\ndeviate from their original trajectories on the user’s behavior, which\nindeed impacts the quality of the generated crowd data. The exploration\nof these effects relies on behavioral metrics to compare the properties\nof trajectories recorded using different paradigms, or with real data.\nOur contributions are threefold:\n1. We introduce the concept of contextual crowds to combine the\nadvantages of immersion in a simulated crowd with those of\nRecord-and-Replay methods, towards consistent crowd motion\ncapture in VR. We propose two alternative setups (3R and 4R),\nand compare their results on two well-studied crowd scenarios.\n2. Using the 3R paradigm, we validate the use of contextual crowds\nto induce interactions during the crowd generation procedure. We\nfurther demonstrate that simulated contexts have similar effects\nas reusing real contexts.\n3. Using the 4R paradigm, we demonstrate that the use of locally\nresponsive agents improves the quality of user collision avoidance,\nat the cost of locally deviating from user-captured-only data.\nAfter discussing related work in Section 2, we introduce the key con\u0002cepts in Section 3, and detail our experiments in Section 4. In Section 5\nwe present our analysis methodology, and discuss the corresponding re\u0002sults in Section 6. We finally discuss our method and the main findings\nin Section 7, before concluding.\n2 RELATED WORK\nIn this section, we explore the connections between crowd data, crowd\ncapture in VR and crowd simulation, and position our work in the\ncontext of modern VR-based crowd dataset capture.\n2.1 Human Crowd Datasets\nHuman crowd datasets are of paramount importance in understand\u0002ing [22], predicting [1, 65] and modeling [68] crowd behavior. Such\ndatasets allowed to study both individual [39] and collective [28] be\u0002havior, under unidirectional [19, 35, 54], multi-directional [12], and\nsome specific navigation scenarios [26]. They are of great interest in\nobserving rich interactions among pedestrians [57], and have been used\nto evaluate simulations [64], to develop knowl",

Despite the need for speed, animals appear to only slowly learn to associate rewarded actions with predictive cues<sup><a href=\"#R1\">1</a>–<a href=\"#R4\">4</a></sup>. This slow learning is thought to be supported by a gradual expansion of predictive cue representation in the sensory cortex<sup><a href=\"#R2\">2</a>,<a href=\"#R5\">5</a></sup>. However, evidence is growing that animals learn more rapidly than classical performance measures suggest<sup><a href=\"#R6\">6</a>–<a href=\"#R8\">8</a></sup>, challenging the prevailing model of sensory cortical plasticity. Here, we investigated the relationship between learning and sensory cortical representations. We trained mice on an auditory go/no-go task that dissociated the rapid acquisition of task contingencies (learning) from its slower expression (performance)<sup><a href=\"#R7\">7</a></sup>. Optogenetic silencing demonstrated that the auditory cortex (AC) drives both rapid learning and slower performance gains but becomes dispensable at expert. Rather than enhancement or expansion of cue representations<sup><a href=\"#R9\">9</a></sup>, two-photon calcium imaging of AC excitatory neurons throughout learning revealed two higher-order signals that were causal to learning and performance. First, a reward prediction (RP) signal emerged rapidly within tens of trials, was present after action-related errors only early in training, and faded at expert levels. Strikingly, silencing at the time of the RP signal impaired rapid learning, suggesting it serves an associative and teaching role.

In his news Broadcast Analysis (1988), he integrates his broad theory of discourse to the discourse of news in the press and applies his theory at both the national and international level to authentic cases of news reports. What makes van Dijk's framework 2005 be distinguished for the analyses of news discourse is not only his demand for a methodical analysis of the structural and the textual level of discourse but also for explanations and analysis at the production and comprehension level as well <mark>(Van Dijk ,2005b</mark>&amp; Boyd-Barrett,1994 Essentially, van Dijk perceives discourse analysis as ideological analysis, since \"ideologies are typically, though not exclusively, expressed and reproduced in discourse and communication, including non-verbal semiotic messages, such as pictures, photographs and movies\". Consequently, van Dijk's approach for investigating ideologies has three parts: discourse analysis, social analysis and cognitive analysis. ...</p></div><div><p>... He expresses social cognition by means of \"the system of mental representations and processes of group members\". In this respect, for van Dijk, \"ideologies … are the overall, abstract mental systems that organize … socially shared attitudes\" <mark>(van Dijk, 2005b)</mark>. Ideologies, therefore, indirectly influence the personal cognition of group members in their performance of comprehension of discourse among other actions and interactions. ...</p></div></div><div><div><div><p>...

It hopes to make a significant contribution to the digital diplomacy literature by examining audience engagement on a digital diplomacy platform. This is done through a discourse analysis of comments that were published over a year starting 1 September 2016. The findings indicated that commenters’ articulations coalesced into two views of the EU in the Philippines: (1) as helpful partner, and (2) as interloper infringing on local sovereignty. The presence of two contrasting discourses allowed for the examination of the nature of discursive contestation on the EU’s Facebook page. The study’s findings highlight the importance of context in order to fully appreciate the discourses that are articulated. The social and discursive aspects of context influenced how commenters articulated themselves. Viewed from a broader perspective, the context also created the conditions for the discursive contestation to occur on the EU Delegation’s page. It is hoped that through this paper, digital diplomacy specialists will gain a better appreciation for engagement on social media platforms, and that they appreciate the significance of the concepts of discourse and context in the work that they do.</span></p></div></div></div><div><div><p>...

It hopes to make a significant contribution to the digital diplomacy literature by examining audience engagement on a digital diplomacy platform. This is done through a discourse analysis of comments that were published over a year starting 1 September 2016. The findings indicated that commenters’ articulations coalesced into two views of the EU in the Philippines: (1) as helpful partner, and (2) as interloper infringing on local sovereignty. The presence of two contrasting discourses allowed for the examination of the nature of discursive contestation on the EU’s Facebook page. The study’s findings highlight the importance of context in order to fully appreciate the discourses that are articulated. The social and discursive aspects of context influenced how commenters articulated themselves. Viewed from a broader perspective, the context also created the conditions for the discursive contestation to occur on the EU Delegation’s page. It is hoped that through this paper, digital diplomacy specialists will gain a better appreciation for engagement on social media platforms, and that they appreciate the significance of the concepts of discourse and context in the work that they do.</span></p></div></div></div><div><div><p>...

Many dialogue agents are driven by conversational data. While they can deliver a reasonable answer, many existing methods fail to address important auxiliary information that is relevant to the conversation, leading to an answer irrelevant to the topic. For instance, in a question-answering system, when an agent is processing a query from a human without external knowledge related to the topic, it is nearly impossible to construct an ideal answer based on facts. Hence, to provide accurate and relevant answers it is critical that an AI agent should leverage external knowledge and respect such knowledge in the generated responses.</p>\n<p>Another emerging need in conversational AI applications is to seek personalized answers so that these answers could help improve user experience and engagement during the conversation. Many existing research efforts have been focused on leveraging the speakers’ persona information to understand the user’s intent and tailor the responses to the specific user.</p>\n<p>In this paper, we focus on incorporating both external knowledge and user persona to improve the quality of answers generated by conversational models. While knowledge provides background information about discussion topics and other ground truth information, it is not guaranteed to generate the response that the user seeks. Without capturing the user’s intention or preference, it is a challenge for a model to satisfy the user’s need. By learning the user’s persona, a model can decide which knowledge a user is looking for. Therefore, learning the user’s persona is critical for a human-like conversation.\nWe propose a novel framework, <span>PK-NCLI</span>, with knowledge and persona grounding based on normalized contextual latent interaction that helps identify relevant knowledge and persona entries to improve the quality of responses generated by two benchmark language models.\nOur experiments demonstrate that <span>PK-NCLI</span> is able to outperform the state-of-the-art persona/knowledge-grounding method, <span>PK-FoCus</span> <cite>[<a href=\"#bib.bib1\">1</a>]</cite>, by 47.80% in terms of language quality, 30.61% in terms of knowledge grounding, and maintain the same persona grounding performance.\nIn addition, our method <span>PK-NCLI</span> improved training efficiency over the baseline by 24.14%.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2>\n<span>II </span><span>Related Work</span>\n</h2>\n<p>With the increasing computational capability of deep neural networks (DNNs), many researchers endeavor to develop AI agents for automated dialog generation for various applications, such as question answering and machine translation.\nHowever, one of the major challenges is to generate informative yet diverse conversations that are suitable in a specific context. One approach is to utilize personalized information (e.g., demographics, hobbies, preferences) to train chatbots that can generate customized conversations.\nLi <span>et al.</span> <cite>[<a href=\"#bib.bib2\">2</a>]</cite> proposed a persona-based dialog generation model, which is capable of generating responses that are consistent with a particular persona.\nSimilarly, Humeau <span>et al.</span> <cite>[<a href=\"#bib.bib3\">3</a>]</cite> proposed an approach in which the neural network is trained on a personality-capturing loss function such that the generated conversation is more likely to align with certain given personality traits.

These constraints largely limit the applicability and scalability of the agents to be widely deployed. Neural networks and data-driven approaches are able to overcome these limits by extracting signals directly from data through end-to-end training without human experts, and their powerful capabilities have been expanded to wider applications.\nThese neural-based models can be further categorized as retrieval-based approaches and generation-based approaches. Retrieval-based models select a response from the pool of candidates by learning similarities between the input query and candidates.\nBi-encoders <cite>[<a href=\"#bib.bib6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#bib.bib7\">7</a>]</cite> and cross-encoders <cite>[<a href=\"#bib.bib8\">8</a>, <a href=\"#bib.bib9\">9</a>]</cite> are two popular approaches\nto learn query-candidate similarities. Bi-encoders typically encode the input query and the response candidates into a lower-dimension space and calculate the similarity by certain distance metrics, while cross-encoders typically pre-fuse the query and candidates together (e.g., text concatenation) and learn a joint embedding before generating a score based on the joint embedding. Humeau <span>et al.</span> <cite>[<a href=\"#bib.bib3\">3</a>]</cite> proposed a poly-encoder, which combines the advantages of both bi-encoder and cross-encoder.\nMany existing information retrieval solutions can also be easily adapted to ranking-based conversation models when the candidate responses are viewed as candidate documents.\nThe state-of-the-art retrieval method, ColBERT <cite>[<a href=\"#bib.bib10\">10</a>]</cite>, leverages contextual latent interactions to better capture the low-level word similarities between the query and documents. They improve the computational performance over the BERT <cite>[<a href=\"#bib.bib8\">8</a>]</cite> model by pre-computing the document embeddings.\nBeyond the cost challenge, retrieval-based models struggle to provide creative and novel responses beyond the prescribed candidates from the dataset. Compared to retrieval-based models, generation-based models are able to provide more novel and creative responses by generating sequences of tokens as the response instead of selecting from an existing dataset.\nRecurrent networks <cite>[<a href=\"#bib.bib2\">2</a>]</cite> and auto-regressive networks <cite>[<a href=\"#bib.bib11\">11</a>, <a href=\"#bib.bib12\">12</a>]</cite> are two popular frameworks for generation tasks.

        "text": "ABSTRACT Firms’ use of information technology (IT) has been suggested to be an important enabler of knowledge production, leading to innovation outcomes in the form of patent inventions. However the innovation process through which IT use influences patent inventions is largely unclear. We draw on the knowledge recombination perspective and develop a model that explains the innovation process through which IT use influences innovation outcomes by looking into a firm’s efforts to recombine existing knowledge (i.e., knowledge recombinant intensity) and the scope of knowledge that is recombined by a firm (i.e., knowledge recombinant diversity). We also distinguish innovation outcomes in terms of patent quantity and quality. Using a large-scale panel dataset, we show that IT use has a stronger impact on knowledge recombinant intensity relative to knowledge recombinant diversity. Moreover, knowledge recombinant intensity and knowledge recombinant diversity play key mediating roles in the relationships between IT use and patent inventions. The impact of IT use on patent quantity is partially mediated, while the impact of IT use on patent quality is fully mediated. Our findings indicate that while IT use can directly affect patent quantity, its impact on patent quality must be channelled through a firm’s knowledge recombinant efforts and scope.",

This study aims to reveal the contribution mechanism of different dimensions of proximity to the recombination innovation at the collaborative dyad level and how this mechanism depends on the characteristics of organizations’ knowledge base structuration. We conceptualize that the interdependence among knowledge elements in the knowledge base forms the knowledge space of the organization and build a theoretical framework to explain the interactive effect of proximity and organizations’ knowledge base characteristics on collaborative recombination innovation. We validated the theoretical hypotheses using Logit regression models based on the longitudinal data of 150 organizations in the global nanotechnology industry. As demonstrated by our findings, technological proximity exerts a negative effect, while geographic proximity exerts an inverted U-shaped effect on collaborative organizations’ joint recombination innovation. Organizations’ knowledge base decomposability plays a negative role in moderating the effect of technological proximity and plays a positive role in regulating the effect of geographic proximity. In contrast, the degree centrality of the knowledge elements positively moderates the effect of both technological and geographic proximity.</p><p>Figures - available from: <a

        "text": "<div><div>\n<p><span></span></p><p>There’s a caveat, and that’s the fact that learning something well takes time. And, time is a resource that we have less and less of as we progress through our careers. That’s why we need a feedback loop that tells us if our we’re actually getting better, or if we need to tweak our strategy. It’s the only (and best) way to be an effective learner and get the result we’re striving for. So, what’s a feedback loop anyway?</p>\n<h2>What’s a feedback loop</h2>\n<p>A feedback loop is just a process of understanding how causes and effects work together.<br/>“Feedback loops allow organisms and systems to maintain control of important processes by signalling back whether an input should be intensified or stopped.” – <span><a href=\"https://www.learning-theories.com/feedback-loops.html\">Learning Theories</a></span>Feedback loops are rife in our bodies. Our brain sends a signal to our body, which send another signal back to our brain, which tweaks the signal and sends it back to our body… etc. Remember the time you accidentally touched a hot stove or iron? Your hand touched the hot surface and sent a signal to your brain, your brain tells your hand “hey, that’s hot, pull your hand away immediately,” and then you suddenly wrench your hand off the hot surface and begin to nurse your wounds. Without this amazing feedback loop, you’d keep burning your hand to a crisp without taking it off the hot surface. That’s why we need feedback loops for effective learning. Without them, we’d keep repeating the same terrible learning strategies with no benefit to our future growth and development.</p>\n<p>There are two types of feedback loops, negative and positive.</p>\n<h4><strong>Negative feedback loops</strong></h4>\n<p>These are feedback loops that maintain homeostasis. It basically aims to keep things the same and balanced. That’s why we sweat when we get too hot or shiver when we’re cold; our brain is trying to maintain a constant body temperature that is optimal for our survival (about 37 degrees Celsius). Without negative feedback loops, we’d be in trouble because we wouldn’t be able to survive. It keeps an optimal internal environment for our survival.</p>\n<h4><strong>Positive feedback loops</strong></h4>\n<p>Positive feedback loops are about growth and development. They’re about creating something new and different. Childbirth is an example of this because the body has to move away from homeostasis and focus on the uncanny process of safely birthing the baby. It’s quite amazing (aside from the unbearable pain, of course!). Positive feedback loops take the body out of its normal ‘safety’ boundaries to ensure that new life is brought into the world and survival can continue.</p>\n<p>So, negative feedback loops keep things the same, and positive feedback loops make sure that we’re growing and developing. Both are essential for learning.</p>\n<h2>What’s a learning feedback loop</h2>\n<p>Feedback loops expose whether your learning strategy is effective. The last thing you want is to spend your precious time using a strategy that doesn’t bring any tangible results – or accidentally learning the wrong thing over and over again – simply because no expert was able to tell you otherwise.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4><strong> </strong><strong>Set goals and define outcomes</strong></h4>\n<p>You have to define what you want to learn, how proficient you want to be, and when you want to have the skill under your belt.</p>\n<p>Using a S.M.A.R.T. goal framework is a great place to start. It helps you set specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and timely goals.</p>\n<p>Goals are just a mental signpost that tells you which way you’re planning to go. Outcomes are the real fruits of your labour; they’re the results at the end of your strategy. You want to specify your learning task outcomes so you can make the best decisions about what to learn, how you’re learning and why you’re learning it in the first place.</p>\n<h4><strong>Start with the smallest and simplest elements</strong></h4>\n<p>The biggest hurdle that makes learners quit is having unrealistic expectations. They jump into their new learning challenges, start with a complex element, and then expect to master their new skill in a short time. No wonder they quit. The key is to start simple and maintain realistic time frames. Otherwise, you’ll just get frustrated, burnt out, and end up driving yourself insane.</p>\n<p>The Japanese concept of ‘Kaizen’ is important to keep in mind. It’s about making small improvements each day, every day. It’s about consistency and making a small effort toward your big learning goal. Often, we get a burst of motivation when we start learning a new thing, we make grand leaps forward, burn out, take a break and then give up altogether. Kaizen makes sure that we don’t fall into this trap.</p>\n<h4><strong>Have a proof of concept</strong></h4>\n<p>We have to regularly test ourselves to see if we’re actually learning. Tests don’t have to be in the form of exams, they just need to provide a proof of concept that your learning strategy is actually working.</p>\n<p>You can conduct a proof of concept by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Having an in-depth conversation about your topic</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Receiving good feedback on a task that uses your new skill</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Measuring your task efficiency before your new skill vs. after your new skill</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Taking an online test to determine your knowledge</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Take an online course to see what you already know and find any gaps in knowledge</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Get a mentor</strong></h4>\n<p>A mentor is a great resource. They help you learn things faster and more holistically. The best thing about mentors is their real-life experience, the stuff that you won’t find in books and courses. A mentor also points out the gaps that we have in our skillset, which meant that they can objectively tell us what we need to learn. This saves us a lot of time and helps us to direct our effort toward the most valuable areas. Mentors also motivate us – they keep us going when things get challenging. You know the feeling, when we don’t get something, we feel stupid, like we’re not cut out for the challenge at hand. In these moments, mentors remind you of how far you’ve come and they show you what you’re good at – something that most of us tend to forget and overlook.</p>\n<h4><strong>Teach what you’ve learned</strong></h4>\n<p>Find someone and teach them something you’ve learned using your own words. Teaching is one of the best ways to learn something because it forces you to be creative and see things from different angles. When you teach, you simplify tough concepts to help the other person understand. It ends up solidifying what you’ve learned as you recall and distill all your learnings into condensed packets of knowledge.</p><p></p>\n</div></div>",

Kaizen makes sure that we don’t fall into this trap.</p>\n<h4><strong>Have a proof of concept</strong></h4>\n<p>We have to regularly test ourselves to see if we’re actually learning. Tests don’t have to be in the form of exams, they just need to provide a proof of concept that your learning strategy is actually working.</p>\n<p>You can conduct a proof of concept by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Having an in-depth conversation about your topic</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Receiving good feedback on a task that uses your new skill</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Measuring your task efficiency before your new skill vs. after your new skill</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Taking an online test to determine your knowledge</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Take an online course to see what you already know and find any gaps in knowledge</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Get a mentor</strong></h4>\n<p>A mentor is a great resource. They help you learn things faster and more holistically. The best thing about mentors is their real-life experience, the stuff that you won’t find in books and courses. A mentor also points out the gaps that we have in our skillset, which meant that they can objectively tell us what we need to learn. This saves us a lot of time and helps us to direct our effort toward the most valuable areas. Mentors also motivate us – they keep us going when things get challenging. You know the feeling, when we don’t get something, we feel stupid, like we’re not cut out for the challenge at hand. In these moments, mentors remind you of how far you’ve come and they show you what you’re good at – something that most of us tend to forget and overlook.</p>\n<h4><strong>Teach what you’ve learned</strong></h4>\n<p>Find someone and teach them something you’ve learned using your own words. Teaching is one of the best ways to learn something because it forces you to be creative and see things from different angles. When you teach, you simplify tough concepts to help the other person understand. It ends up solidifying what you’ve learned as you recall and distill all your learnings into condensed packets of knowledge.</p><p></p>\n</div></div>",

We find that inward-looking firms are more susceptible to internal\nembeddedness and that centrality in the collaborative network flattens rather than shifts the\nrelationship between reuse and impact. These findings elevate the theoretical discourse of\nembeddedness from the effects of network positions on innovation outcomes to similar network\npositions having asymmetric effects that vary with the firm’s search orientation. Our results\ncontribute to an emergent area in innovation research on how inventor networks shape the\ninventive process and its outcomes.\nKeywords: Patents; knowledge recombination; innovation; embeddedness; networks; search\nThe development, acquisition, management, and transfer of knowledge within and across\nfirms has occupied scholars for decades (Appleyard, 1996; Grant, 1996; Kogut & Zander,\n1992; Matusik, 2002; Polanyi, 1966, 2009). In general, knowledge evolves through recom\u0002binant processes and the exchange of ideas (Johnson, 2011; Nelson & Winter, 1982;\nSchumpeter, 1934), both within and beyond organizational boundaries, by individuals who\nare embedded in knowledge and collaborative networks that support the pooling of resources\n(Guan & Liu, 2016; Uzzi, 1996). During the recombinant process, inventors exploit their\nsocial networks in order to gather insights, validate information, and challenge their own\nvantage points. We focus on a subset of recombinations, namely, those that reuse techno\u0002logically similar components, and hypothesize that internal knowledge reuse relates curvi\u0002linearly (inverted U shape) to invention impact. We examine how these concave relationships\nare influenced by network characteristics and a firm’s search orientation.\nThe relationship between the reuse of technologically similar components and invention\nimpact is explained by two counteracting latent mechanisms.1 Absorptive capacity increases\nwith the degree of reuse because the prior use of components creates knowledge in which\nabsorptive capacity is grounded (Zahra & George, 2002; Zou, Ertug, & George, 2018). At the\nsame time, an increasing degree of reuse reduces the novelty creation potential, because\nteams that rehash similar component combinations exhibit less exploration, which negatively\ncorrelates with novelty and eventually with impact. Both absorptive capacity (which influ\u0002ences an invention’s usefulness) and novelty are required to create a patentable invention.\nThus, we suggest that the concave shape is explained through the multiplicative effects of\nincreasing team absorptive capacity and decreasing novelty creation as the degree of reuse\nincreases (Gilsing, Nooteboom, Vanhaverbeke, Duysters, & van den Oord, 2008; Nooteboom,\nvan Haverbeke, Duysters, Gilsing, & Van den Oord, 2007).\nRecombinant processes, however, do not happen in a vacuum. Prior research has estab\u0002lished that inventors are doubly embedded in knowledge networks and in networks of col\u0002laborative ties (Guan & Liu, 2016; C. Wang, Rodan, Fruin, & Xu, 2014). We investigate the\nmoderating role of two dimensions of the collaborative tie network. Internal embeddedness\nis the quality of being ingrained in an intraorganizational network of social relationships that\nenable knowledge exchange through the routinization and stabilization of linkages among\norganizational members (Gulati, 1998; Uzzi, 1996). This specialized form of embeddedness\ncaptures the relative ease (in terms of tie strength) with which the focal team has access to\ncolleagues with domain knowledge. We posit that as internal knowledge reuse increases,\ninternal embeddedness will steepen the concave relation between reuse and impact. Next, we\nSchillebeeckx et al. / Knowledge Recombination and Inventor Networks 3\nlook at the moderating effects of a team’s network centrality, which we operationalize\nthrough the team members’ mean degree centrality in the industry collaboration network. We\nargue that network centrality will enhance a team’s potential for novelty creation thanks to\nincreased access to information. This leads us to suggest that the moderating effect of net\u0002work centrality will consist of an inflection point shift of the relationship between internal\nknowledge reuse and invention impact.\nFinally, we add a third layer of embeddedness by recognizing inventor teams are also\nembedded within their own firms. Such firms, even within an industry, can be highly het\u0002erogeneous, and much-studied differentiators are the firm’s knowledge base and search\nbehavior (Hoopes, Madsen, & Walker, 2003; March, 1991; H. Wang, Choi, Wan, & Dong,\n2016). Search orientation is a characteristic of the firm’s knowledge base that reveals the\nfirm’s historical tendency to search internally or externally, which could affect the effec\u0002tiveness with which firms reuse knowledge. We split our sample into two separate groups\nof internally and externally oriented firms and ask whether the hypothesized effects would\ndiffer for either.\nThis research contributes to an emergent area in innovation research that examines the\ninterplay of the knowledge network from which teams select and reuse components and\nthe collaboration network in which they are embedded (Guan & Liu, 2016; C. Wang et al.,\n2014). Prior work finds that both networks are decoupled because collaborative patterns\nof researchers differ from co-occurrence patterns of components because an industry’s\nknowledge component combinations at least partially precede the current community of\nactive researchers (C. Wang et al., 2014). By investigating interactions between knowl\u0002edge reuse and collaborative networks at the level of the invention, our study advances\nour understanding of how knowledge and inventor networks are interlinked and jointly\ninfluence the impact of inventions.\nOur findings shine new light on the “paradox of embeddedness,” which suggests that\nembeddedness may facilitate as well as hinder knowledge transfer (Asakawa, Park, Song,\n& Kim, 2017; Uzzi, 1997). While studies have shown that different types of embeddedness\ncan influence knowledge-related outcomes in diverse ways (e.g., Asakawa et al., 2017), we\nfind that the",

        "text": "Communities of practice, interaction, and recurrent interaction patterns\nA consistent analytical framework for studying knowledge processes in organizations\nMarkus C. Becker\nUniversity of Southern Denmark,\nDepartment of Marketing,\nCampusvej 55,\n5230 Odense M,\nDenmark,\nTel. 0045-65503350\nmab@sam.sdu.dk\nAcademic Track\nThird European Conference on Organizational Knowledge, Learning and Capabilities,\nAthens, 5-6 April 2002\n2\nAbstract\nThe objectives of this paper are to review the most often used levels of analysis in researching\nhow knowledge retrieval, utilization, integration, and transfer processes in organizations\nwork, to clarify how these approaches differ, and to identify the most productive research\napproach for understanding the mechanisms and processes underlying knowledge retrieval,\nutilization, integration, and transfer in organizations. Three levels of analysis that are common\nin the literature on knowledge in organizations are firms, teams resp. groups, and\ncommunities of practice. In the literature, the latter are identified as the level of analysis that\nappears to be most comprehensive of those empirical phenomena important for understanding\nknowledge processes in organizations. The case studies drawn on support this finding and\nfurther support the notion that the key underlying process within teams seems to be\ninteraction. It turns out that this idea is also strongly supported in early sociology. The paper\nthus proposes to (i) make the community of practice the most important level of analysis in\nresearch into knowledge processes in organizations – picking up but reinforcing researchers\nfollowing Brown and Duguid (1991), and (ii) to make interaction the key definitional criterion\nof teams and thus a key analytical category. Following on from these proposals, a practical\nunit of analysis is proposed: If interaction is of analytical interest, and most of the interaction\nof interest is recurrent, then ‘recurrent interaction patterns’ will capture most of what is of\ninterest for the present questions. Therefore, ‘recurrent interaction patterns’ can serve as a unit\nof analysis. As shown in the paper, ‘recurrent interaction patterns’ is also a more precise\ninterpretation of the term ‘routines’ (Nelson and Winter 1982). The paper argues for a\nresearch program into the questions of knowledge retrieval and utilization, integration and\ntransfer in organizations that focuses on communities of practice and interaction within such\ncommunities, applying ‘recurrent interaction patterns’ as units of analysis.\n3\nCommunities of practice, interaction, and recurrent interaction patterns\nA consistent analytical framework for studying knowledge processes in organizations\nMarkus C. Becker\nAs the themes of this conference reflect, one of the most pertinent open research questions\nwith regard to organizational knowledge, learning and capabilities is: How do knowledge\nretrieval, utilization, integration, and transfer processes in organizations work?\nThe objectives of this paper are to review some of the most often used approaches in\nresearching this question, to clarify how these approaches differ, and to identify the most\nproductive research approach for understanding the mechanisms and processes underlying\nknowledge retrieval, utilization, integration, and transfer in organizations.\nInterestingly, the literature concerned with these questions points to several different levels\nand units of analysis. Both firms (Grant 1996), and entities like teams, groups, and\n‘communities of practice’ (Brown and Duguid 1991; Lave and Wenger 1991) have been said\nto play important roles in the knowledge processes mentioned above. The researcher\ninterested in the questions mentioned above is thus confronted with a crossroads: Which level\nand unit of analysis to choose? Problem arise for two reasons. Firms, teams, groups, and\ncommunities of practice clearly are distinct levels of analysis. Which level of analysis is the\nappropriate one for what question? Furthermore, it is not clear whether the two levels of\nanalysis are connected to each other or not. Can a researcher only choose one of the\nalternatives and then has to neglect the others? If this is not so, how can the analysis draw on\nseveral of these levels of analysis? How are they connected?\nThe paper is structured as follows. First, the various streams of literature that propose and\napply the firm, the team, the group, and the community of practice in analyzing knowledge\nretrieval, utilization, integration, and transfer processes in organizations are briefly reviewed.\nThe second part then draws on a multiple case study carried out in ten customer service\ncenters in the Republic of Ireland, the third on sociological literature in order to put the\nempirical findings on a firm fundament. The concluding section develops implications for\nfurther research.\n4\nThe roles of firms, teams, groups, and communities of practice in knowledge retrieval,\nutilization, integration, and transfer processes in organizations\nThis first part of the paper reviews the different levels of analysis that have been applied to\nconceptualize knowledge retrieval, utilization, integration, and transfer processes in\norganizations. We first review the role of firms, then turn to teams and groups, and finally to\ncommunities of practice. For each1\n, we will carve out how precisely these levels of analysis\ndiffer from each other, and what the literature holds to be their roles in the above mentioned\nknowledge processes.\na) Firms\nThe literature constituting the so-called 'Knowledge-Based Approach' to the theory of the firm\nis the natural starting point for a review of the literature on the role of firms in knowledge\nretrieval, utilization, integration, and transfer processes. According to the overview in Foss\nand Foss (1999), the 'Knowledge-Based Approach' (KBA) looks at the research questions of\nthe theory of the firm (existence of the firm, boundaries of the firm, internal organization of\nthe firm, competitive advantage) through the lenses of characteristics of resources, routines\nand capabilities, bounded rationality, and learning. The starting point of this literature2 is the\nexplanation of why firms exist. One potential explanation – championed by the KBA – is that\nfirms are more efficient than markets in producing, storing and utilizing knowledge,\nparticularly tacit knowledge (Kogut and Zander 1992). By way of summary, the KBA sees\nfirms as fulfilling the following knowledge-related roles:\n- creating (Spender 1992, Kogut and Zander 1993),\n- transfering (Kogut and Zander 1993),\n- recombining (Kogut and Zander 1992, Kogut and Zander 1993),\n- applying (Grant 1996), and\n- integrating knowledge (Grant 1996; see also Grant 1991).\nHow do firms perform these knowledge roles, however? The knowledge process that the\nKBA provides most insights on is knowledge integration. We will therefore focus on\n1\nWith the exception of the firm.\n5\nknowledge integration in this paragraph. The KBA argues that what firms do to achieve\nintegration of knowledge is to create the conditions for knowledge integration. According to\nGhoshal and Moran (1996), firms have unique advantages for governing certain types of\neconomic activities from a logic very different from that of a market. Grant (1996) argues that\nintegrating the knowledge of many different individuals is precisely such a logic. Firms exist\nbecause they can create conditions under which multiple individuals can integrate their\nspecialist knowledge. Such conditions include for instance incentives designed to foster\ncoordination between individual specialists (Grant 1996). This argument can be extended to\nother knowledge processes, not just knowledge integration. According to Hodgson, firms can\nbe seen as endowed with particular institutional capabilities which enable them to develop,\nbind, and protect organizational and individual competences and knowledge. In this\nperspective, the firm is an enclave 'protecting against the potentially corrosive forces of the\nmarket' (cf. Hodgson 1999b, 214; Hodgson 1999c, 89). Take learning as an example. The\nmarket – with its 'high-powered' incentives – is very good at inducing, motivating, triggering\nlearning processes. These learning processes, however, subsequently have to be sheltered\nfrom the market that induced them, in order to be able to unfold. If the incentives are unclear,\nchange fast, or concern various topics with regard to which learning is attractive, then the\nlearning processes will either not be carried through fully, be interrupted, or will be\nabandoned. Further on in the learning process, learning results have to be retained. To the\nextent that it has been individual organisation members that have engaged in the learning\nprocess, the problem is one of knowledge integration, a problem to which – according to the\nKBA – the firm presents a solution in providing the conditions for knowledge integration.\nProviding the conditions for knowledge integration does not mean providing knowledge\nintegration, however. What are the mechanisms underlying the integration of knowledge in\nfirms? For Kogut and Zander (1992), firms apply a set of higher-order organizing principles\n(i.e., organizing principles not reducable to individuals). Grant (1991) specifies such\norganizing principles as the following mechanisms for integrating specialized knowledge:\n- rules and directives,\n- sequencing,\n- routines,\n- group problem solving and decision making.\n2\nFor instance Barney 1991, Conner 1991, Dosi and Marengo 1994, Grant 1996, Kogut and Zander 1992, Kogut\nand Zander 1993, Madhok 1996, Penrose 1959, Peteraf 1993, Spender 1996, Winter 1988; for an overview see\nFoss and Foss 1999).\n6\nThis is about as far as the KBA has pushed the analysis of the roles of firms in knowledge\nretrieval, utilization, integration, and transfer processes.

        "text": "1\nThe Concept of Knowledge Communication and Its Relevance to\nManagement\nUSI Research Note\nJuly 2006, Version 2.2\nMartin J. Eppler, School of Communication Sciences, University of Lugano (USI), Switzerland,\nMartin.Eppler@lu.unisi.ch, www.knowledge-communication.org\nAbstract:\nIn this research note we illustrate the relevance of the notion of knowledge communication for management. We outline\nwhere and how the communication of expertise from specialists to decision makers is crucial. We introduce key elements of\nthe concept of knowledge communication and review influential theoretical constructs that explain why knowledge\ncommunication among experts and decision makers frequently fails.\n1. INTRODUCTION: THE IMPORTANCE OF KNOWLEDGE COMMUNICATION\nIN MANAGEMENT\nCommunicating professional knowledge is a key activity for today’s specialized workforce.\nThe efficient and effective transfer of experiences, insights, and know-how among different\nexperts and decision makers is a prerequisite for high-quality decision making and co\u0002ordinated, organizational action (Straub & Karahanna, 1998; Rosenthal & ‘t Hart, 1991).\nSituations of such deliberate (interfunctional) knowledge transfer through interpersonal\ncommunication or group conversations (Gratton & Goshal, 2002, Tsoukas 1996) can be found\nin many business constellations, as the following typical examples illustrate: Technology\nexperts present their evaluation of a new technology to management in order to jointly devise\na new production strategy (McDermott, 1999). Engineers who have discovered how to master\na difficult manufacturing process need to convey their methods to engineers in other business\nunits (Szulanski, 1996, 1999). Legal experts brief a management team on the implications of\nnew regulations on their business model (Wilmotte & Morgan, 1984). Experts from various\ndomains need to share their views and insights regarding a common goal in order to agree on\na common rating of risks, requirements (Browne & Ramesh, 2002), industries or clients.\nProject leaders need to present their results to the upper management and share their\nexperiences of past projects in order to assess the potential of new project candidates\n2\n(Schindler & Eppler, 2003). Scientists who work as drug developers present new avenues for\nfuture products that business unit managers must assess. Market researchers present their\nstatistical analyses of recent consumer surveys to the head of marketing (Boland et al., 2001).\nStrategy consultants present the findings of their strategic company assessment to the board of\ndirectors in order to devise adequate measures (Creplet et al., 2001).\nWhat these diverse situations all have in common is the problem of knowledge asymmetry\n(Sharma, 1997) that has to be resolved through interpersonal communication. While the\nmanager typically has the authority to make strategic or tactical decisions, he or she often\nlacks the specialized expertise required to make an informed decision on a complex issue\n(Watson, 2004). Because of the wide scope of decisions that need to be made, a manager\nfrequently has to delegate the decision preparation to experts who – based on their\nprofessional training and previous experience – can analyze complex situations or\ntechnological options in a more reliable manner. The results of such analyses then need to be\ncommunicated back to the manager, often under considerable time constraints. The\nknowledge communication challenge, however, begins long before that, at the time when the\nmanager has to convey his or her knowledge needs and decision constraints to the experts in\norder to delegate the analysis task effectively.\n2. BACKGROUND: THE CONCEPT OF KNOWLEDGE COMMUNICATION\nBased on the reasoning described in the previous section, we define knowledge\ncommunication as the (deliberate) activity of interactively conveying and co-constructing\ninsights, assessments, experiences, or skills through verbal and non-verbal means. Knowledge\ncommunication has taken place when an insight, experience or skill has been successfully\nreconstructed by an individual because of the communicative actions of another. Knowledge\ncommunication thus designates the successful transfer of know-how (e.g., how to accomplish\na task), know-why (e.g., the cause-effect relationships of a complex phenomenon), know\u0002what (e.g., the results of a test), and know-who (e.g., the experiences with others) through\nface-to-face (co-located) or media-based (virtual) interactions. This type of knowledge\ncommunication can take place synchronously or asynchronously1\n. The first mode of\ncommunication refers to (often face to face) real-time interactions, while the latter designates\ndelayed (usually media-based) interactions.\nWe use the term knowledge dialogues for the first type of (synchronous) knowledge\ncommunication, stressing the interactive and collaborative style of knowledge exchange in\nthis communication mode (see Isaacs, 1997, Nonaka et al., 2000). Depending on the\nknowledge-focused goal of such dialogues, we distinguish among Crealogues (that focus on\nin the creation of new insights), Sharealogues (facilitating knowledge transfer), Assessalogues\n1\nBoth modes can be used in one-to-one or one-to-many contexts. Both modes can rely on speech, text,\ngraphics, and other means of communication (i.e., verbal and non-verbal).\n3\n(focusing on the evaluation of new insights) and Doalogues (e.g., turning understanding into\ncommitted action, i.e., ‘talk the walk’). Each type of knowledge dialogue requires different\nbehavior and interaction patterns and support measures (e.g., whereas Assessalogues require\ncritical, convergent evaluation tools, Crealogues require an open atmosphere for divergent\nthinking and rapid idea generation without judgment).\nWith regard to asynchronous knowledge communication, we refer to the concept of\nknowledge media (see Eppler et al., 1999) that enable knowledge transfer through\ntechnology-based communication, collaboration, e-learning, aggregation, retrieval and\narchiving services. Knowledge media can be differentiated in terms of their target community,\ne.g., scientific knowledge media, public knowledge media, professional knowledge media,\netc. The concept of knowledge media in general stresses the importance of a community that\ncollaborates regularly using a common platform that consists not only of IT-functionalities,\nbut also of common communication norms and (usage) rules.\nIn this understanding, knowledge communication is more than communicating information\n(e.g., facts, figures, events, situations, developments, etc.) or emotions (e.g., fears, hopes,\nreservations, commitment) because it requires conveying context, background, and basic\nassumptions. It requires the communication of personal insights and experiences.\nCommunicating insights requires the elicitation of one’s rationale and reasoning (i.e., one’s\nargumentation structure), of one’s perspective, ratings and priorities, and of one’s hunches\nand intuition. At times it may even be necessary to present an overview of the expert’s\nrelevant skills along with his/her previous professional experiences and credentials (Lunce et\nal., 1993) in order to build trust and enable an adequate atmosphere for effective knowledge\ntransfer. Thus, in addition to pure information (and at times emotion), a myriad of other\nindicators need to be provided in order to transfer knowledge. These indicators help the\nperson who requires insights from another to understand the other’s perspective, to re\u0002construct the other’s insights correctly, and to connect them to one’s own prior knowledge.\nStill, knowledge communication does not only differ in terms of what is communicated\n(knowledge in context rather than isolated data or information2\n), but also how one\ncommunicates. The transfer of information can often be successful without additional effort\nbeyond an ordinary, every day communication style. Communicating expertise-based,\ncomplex insights, by contrast, calls for didactic tricks and at times sophisticated indirect\nspeech acts and visualization means that help the other side to become actively involved in the\n2\nOur distinction between data, information, and knowledge follows the main stream conception found in\ncurrent literature (see for example Davenport & Prusak, 1998).

Eppler, School of Communication Sciences, University of Lugano (USI), Switzerland,\nMartin.Eppler@lu.unisi.ch, www.knowledge-communication.org\nAbstract:\nIn this research note we illustrate the relevance of the notion of knowledge communication for management. We outline\nwhere and how the communication of expertise from specialists to decision makers is crucial. We introduce key elements of\nthe concept of knowledge communication and review influential theoretical constructs that explain why knowledge\ncommunication among experts and decision makers frequently fails.\n1. INTRODUCTION: THE IMPORTANCE OF KNOWLEDGE COMMUNICATION\nIN MANAGEMENT\nCommunicating professional knowledge is a key activity for today’s specialized workforce.\nThe efficient and effective transfer of experiences, insights, and know-how among different\nexperts and decision makers is a prerequisite for high-quality decision making and co\u0002ordinated, organizational action (Straub & Karahanna, 1998; Rosenthal & ‘t Hart, 1991).\nSituations of such deliberate (interfunctional) knowledge transfer through interpersonal\ncommunication or group conversations (Gratton & Goshal, 2002, Tsoukas 1996) can be found\nin many business constellations, as the following typical examples illustrate: Technology\nexperts present their evaluation of a new technology to management in order to jointly devise\na new production strategy (McDermott, 1999). Engineers who have discovered how to master\na difficult manufacturing process need to convey their methods to engineers in other business\nunits (Szulanski, 1996, 1999). Legal experts brief a management team on the implications of\nnew regulations on their business model (Wilmotte & Morgan, 1984). Experts from various\ndomains need to share their views and insights regarding a common goal in order to agree on\na common rating of risks, requirements (Browne & Ramesh, 2002), industries or clients.\nProject leaders need to present their results to the upper management and share their\nexperiences of past projects in order to assess the potential of new project candidates\n2\n(Schindler & Eppler, 2003). Scientists who work as drug developers present new avenues for\nfuture products that business unit managers must assess. Market researchers present their\nstatistical analyses of recent consumer surveys to the head of marketing (Boland et al., 2001).\nStrategy consultants present the findings of their strategic company assessment to the board of\ndirectors in order to devise adequate measures (Creplet et al., 2001).\nWhat these diverse situations all have in common is the problem of knowledge asymmetry\n(Sharma, 1997) that has to be resolved through interpersonal communication.

The model, trained on vast amounts of text data, has learned the likelihood of each token following a given sequence of tokens. When generating text, it calculates these probabilities and selects the token with the highest likelihood.</span>\n</p>\n<div>\n<h2>Recommended by LinkedIn</h2>\n</div>\n<p>\n<span>The idea of moving probabilities to the desired outcome involves guiding the model towards a particular type of response or content. By carefully crafting the input prompt or using specific techniques like iterative dialogue, one can influence the model's probability calculations. This approach effectively nudges the model to activate certain parts of its latent space, aligning the generated content more closely with the desired outcome. For example, in a business context, framing questions or prompts to be more focused on market trends can steer the GPT model to generate responses that are more aligned with economic analysis.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Here’s how it works in practical scenarios:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>1. </span><span>Styling Responses</span><span>: By providing specific style cues in the prompt, such as “Write in a formal tone” or “Explain like I'm five,” the AI activates different aspects of its training to adhere to the requested style.</span>\n</p>\n<div>\n<pre><span>User&gt;&gt; \"AI, can you explain quantum physics in a way that a five-year-old would understand?\"\nAI&gt;&gt; \"Sure!

There is a test for the disease, but it's not perfect: If you have the disease, the test is positive 90% of the time. If you don't have the disease, the test is positive 5% of the time. What's the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease?\"\nAI's Solution: \"Using Bayes Theorem, the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease is approximately 26.47%.\"\n#\nSecond Example (provided to the AI):\nProblem: \"A bag contains 3 red marbles and 7 blue marbles. A marble is drawn randomly from the bag, what is the probability that it is red?\"\nAI's Solution: \"The probability of drawing a red marble is 3 out of 10, or 30%.\"\n#\nThe Problem:\nProblem: \"A software has a 95% accuracy in identifying a code bug.

Introduction</p>\n<p>Today, it is essential that software applications are able to adapt to their environment. The vision of Weiser [1] on Ubiquitous computing and works of Dey et al. [2] [3] about context opened the way for a multitude of solutions to this problem. The majority of these solutions (named Auto adaptive system in <a href=\"#f1\">Figure 1</a>) operate according to the cycle “observation, decision, action” as shown in <a href=\"#f1\">Figure 1</a>, and take their decision based on the set of rules (or equivalent) which</p>\n<div>\n<p></p>\n<p><a><span>Figure 1</span></a>. Classical model of Auto adaptive system.</p>\n</div>\n<p>define the adaptation capacities (also call adaptation range) of the application (or provide by the Auto adaptive system). But problems remain with those solutions and in particular if we want to improve the adaptation capacities to take into account new situations or contexts. Indeed, the interest of having an automatic adaptation of an application to the context is to allow the continuity in the services of the user, and that, whatever the context. If we add this to the increasing mobility of users, it is necessary to adapt the applications to all situations of life, whether professional, personal or others.</p>\n<p>With this system, if we want to increase the adaptation capacities which are necessary in order to take account of the continuity of user services, we must use more Adaptation Rules to drive the decision process. But this results in:</p>\n<p>- System takes more time to adapt properly.</p>\n<p>- System consumption increases (memory, power …).</p>\n<p>- Risk of conflict between Adaptation Rules is also increasing.</p>\n<p>Many works have been dedicated to advance the adaptation domain [4] ; frame- works [2] [5] [6] , methods and techniques [3] [7] [8] [9] , principles [10] [11] have already been proposed. However, most of these information focus on solving problems of system at runtime and they do not provide any solution to separate concerns and responsiveness in dynamic context-aware system. Some others su- ppose to use meta-model [7] [11] , in design time that consistently defines related concepts, properties and relationships, establishing a common ground for implementing adaptation. This approach provides a good solution to manage con- text elements but it makes each expert’s task become complicated.</p>\n<p>In this paper, we propose an approach called Intermediate Common Model with main purpose that is improving the adaptation capacities of system. Intermediate Common Model uses independent views that will increase the reuse of views between different applications. In addition, we propose to use context- aware management to manage views; it is the solution to separate concerns and responsiveness in dynamic context-aware system.</p>\n<p>This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents and discuss related work, motivates this research; Section 3 details hypotheses and architecture of system; Section 4 describes Intermediate Common Model; Section 5 applies the results and implementation; Section 6 presents limitation of approach and Section 7 concludes this work and future work.</p>\n<p>2. Related Works and Motivation</p>\n<p>We can find many work has been done in the area of context-aware application in the past few year. In this section we present the results or proposals of works that focus on building context-aware application based on models to improve the adaptation capacities of system.</p>\n<p>The work has been done by Dey et al. [2] which develop a context toolkit based on composed of sensor to collect information from context. This architecture supports a framework and reusability of components, evolution of applications and the acquisition and use of complex context. The context toolkit provides methods to access to such information, transform the context information into high-level formats that are easier to handle, allow the separation of acquisition process and context representation of the adaptation. However, these systems do not provide solution to use specific views and context management, so it is become complicated to use in large system with the wide range of context.</p>\n<p>Henricksen [10] focuses on modeling at the conceptual level using Context Modeling Language, a novel modelling approach which offers a graphical notation and an accompanying modelling methodology for describing context information. A modeling process involving the following steps is assumed: construction of a conceptual model of context requirements using Context Modeling Language; mapping of the conceptual model to the relational model; and generation of a context management infrastructure based on the relational model. This approach use domain independent support on developing context- aware system but it is slightly hindered by the absence of a context modeling editor.</p>\n<p>Person is AD [5] , is a context-aware framework which builds upon the homogenous modeling of all the entities relevant to supporting ubiquitous applications. In this approach, the model is organized as a tree of model context which contain the components of the model. This framework makes it possible to quickly create new context-aware applications. The Person is AD architecture is based upon a small set of operations for applications to interact with the models: access, ask and tell. The service discovery facilitates distributing the models across various machines across a network. The application writer can simply use these, in conjunction with the active models, to build applications. This approach offers reusing active model in different applications but it does not consider infor- mation about the context-aware system behavior. Moreover, they do not provide an solution to replace or change model when the application change during adaptation process.</p>\n<p>Costa [12] proposes an integrated solution for development of context-aware system. In this approach, context-aware application behaviors can be described as logic rules, which are called Event-Condition-Action rules that are consistent with the Event-Control-Action pattern. The context processor component gathers context information from the user’s environment performs context reasoning and generates context and situation events. The controller Component observes events from context processors, monitors conditions rules, and triggers actions on action performer when the condition is satisfied. This approach provides a solution that facilitates the dynamic configuration and execution of particular application behaviors which based on a rule engine that gathers context and situation values from context processing components. However, this approach was not support so- lution to separate the management context and adaptation process and no concrete implementation was suggested.</p>\n<p>Achilleas, Kun and Nektarios [6] propose a model-driven approach that provides a higher level of automation in software generation. The approach is strictly based on the Model Driven Architecture paradigm and provides the capability to semi-automatically generate service creation environments for different application domains. Hence, the approach and the generic framework are utilized to de- fine and generate the Context Modeling Framework in the form of an Eclipse plug in. The plug in is then integrated into the generic framework, comprising a new software capability. Consequently, merely the modelling, validation and implementation tasks must be carried out for the creation of pervasive services. In addition the capability to generate diverse implementations and deploy pervasive services on different devices is provided. This simplifies the process and enables the rapid creation of pervasive services at the static compile time. Although this approach supports the ATL editor to transfer context to context, they do not provide solution to use independent models which can increase reusability of views.</p>\n<p>CAISDA [7] provides architecture of context-aware framework which is formed of two parties. It describes the development process of a context-aware application by the developer in design time for it is consistent with us framework in run time. In the other hand, it describes the architecture of this framework in run time. In design time, the developer must build a context model of its application to be consistent with meta-model and follow a set of steps guided by mechanisms and tools to generate at the end a context-aware application integrated in the CAISDA framework. In runtime, when the user launches the application, it must be able to capture and to interpret the context elements possible to change during the application execution. This approach is good with applications which use single view but with applications use many different views, the analyze context will become complicate and take more time.</p>\n<p>Requirements of Context-aware system are identified depend on each part of system such as Context model, architecture of system, development and deploy- ment of applications.</p>\n<p>Firstly, with Context model, some requirements are inspired from works in the previous section such as Domain independent [7] , Rich and Dynamics context [2] , Behavioral and Structural [12] . Another important requirement of Con- text model is “Change and Reuse of views” that is use to improve adaptation ability, simplify expert’s work and develop application.

For example, the statement “It’s raining” is true only in the context of a given location and time.

There is no need to define all possible aspects of the world that may determine a particular context, only those relevant to a given circumstance.

        "text": "<div><div>\n<div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>In naturalistic settings, the stream of experiences is often not independent and identically distributed (iid). In particular, humans are constantly confronted with experiences that are context-dependent, and the underlying context is often temporally persistent. Consider the example of learning two similar languages, such as Norwegian and Swedish. First, natural language inputs are temporally auto-correlated—as a Norwegian travels to Sweden, he or she will experience Swedish for an extended period of time. As experiences are governed by auto-correlated contexts (Sweden versus Norway), learning can be facilitated by partitioning experiences according to their underlying contexts (or tasks) to prevent inter-context interference. In this example, lumping the two contexts, Sweden versus Norway, can cause interference for context-dependent responding (e.g., the word “water” is “vann” in Norwegian and “vatten” in Swedish). However, as many of the words are shared across these two languages (the word “book” is “bok” in both Norwegian and Swedish), it is also beneficial to dedicate a set of shared representations to maintain the regularities common across contexts. How should the brain maintain shared structure and context-specific structure simultaneously?</p><p>One promising approach to context-dependent learning is the theory of latent cause inference (LCI). This theory proposes that humans assign latent causes (LCs) to experiences to facilitate learning, prediction, memory, and generalization in a context-dependent manner (Fig. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64272-5#Fig1\">1</a>)<sup><a href=\"#ref-CR1\">1</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR2\">2</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR3\">3</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR4\">4</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR5\">5</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR6\">6</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64272-5#ref-CR7\">7</a></sup>. In the domain of event cognition, this theory was recently instantiated as a computational modeling framework known as Structured Event Memory (SEM)<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64272-5#ref-CR3\">3</a></sup>. SEM addresses several important problems. First, SEM uses a Bayesian nonparametric algorithm to assign LCs to the observations. As the number of inferred LCs grows in an adaptive manner, SEM does not need to assume the number of contexts is known a priori. Second, SEM uses a dedicated neural network to represent each LC<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64272-5#ref-CR3\">3</a></sup>, which is related to the mixtures of experts architecture<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64272-5#ref-CR8\">8</a></sup>. As representations of different LCs are fully separated into different networks, this circumvents catastrophic interference even if experiences are presented according to a blocked curriculum (i.e., a temporally extended period of exposure to experiences from one context, followed by a temporally extended period of exposure to experiences from a different context)—this is a key advantage of SEM over standard neural networks lacking this LC inference mechanism, which can show catastrophic interference in this situation<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64272-5#ref-CR9\">9</a></sup> (see the \"<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64272-5#Sec6\">Discussion</a>\" section for a summary of other relevant models of context-dependent learning).</p><div><figure><figcaption><b>Figure 1</b></figcaption><div><div><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64272-5/figures/1\"></a></div><p>How latent cause inference partitions experience.

In particular, its use of distinct representations for different LCs prevents it from representing shared structure.

As such, SEM does not provide an answer to the question, raised above, of how we simultaneously represent context-dependent knowledge and shared structure. Moreover, when using fully separated neural networks to store knowledge about different contexts, the amount of required neural resource scales linearly as a function of the number of inferred LCs, which is computationally infeasible. The goal of this paper is to assess whether it is possible to modify the SEM architecture to better represent shared structure, without compromising its ability to account for human event segmentation (as evidenced by the two findings noted above).

        "html": "<div><div>\n<div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>In naturalistic settings, the stream of experiences is often not independent and identically distributed (iid). In particular, humans are constantly confronted with experiences that are context-dependent, and the underlying context is often temporally persistent. Consider the example of learning two similar languages, such as Norwegian and Swedish. First, natural language inputs are temporally auto-correlated—as a Norwegian travels to Sweden, he or she will experience Swedish for an extended period of time. As experiences are governed by auto-correlated contexts (Sweden versus Norway), learning can be facilitated by partitioning experiences according to their underlying contexts (or tasks) to prevent inter-context interference. In this example, lumping the two contexts, Sweden versus Norway, can cause interference for context-dependent responding (e.g., the word “water” is “vann” in Norwegian and “vatten” in Swedish). However, as many of the words are shared across these two languages (the word “book” is “bok” in both Norwegian and Swedish), it is also beneficial to dedicate a set of shared representations to maintain the regularities common across contexts.

Extant literature suggests that a user’s cognitive and affective responses toward a VH depend on the extent to which the interaction elicits a sense of copresence, or the subjective “sense of being together.” Furthermore, prior research has linked copresence to important social outcomes (e.g., likeability and trust), emphasizing the need to understand which factors contribute to this psychological state. Although there is some understanding of the determinants of copresence in virtual reality (VR) (cf. <a href=\"#B39\">Oh et al., 2018</a>), it is less known what determines copresence in mixed reality (MR), a modality wherein VHs have unique access to social cues in a “real-world” setting. In the current study, we examined the extent to which a VH’s responsiveness to events occurring in the user’s physical environment increased a sense of copresence and heightened affective connections to the VH. Participants (<em>N</em> = 65) engaged in two collaborative tasks with a (nonspeaking) VH using an MR headset. In the first task, no event in the participant’s physical environment would occur, which served as the control condition. In the second task, an event in the participants’ physical environment occurred, to which the VH either responded or ignored depending on the experimental condition. Copresence and interpersonal evaluations of the VHs were measured after each collaborative task <em>via</em> self-reported measures. Results show that when the VH responded to the physical event, participants experienced a significant stronger sense of copresence than when the VH did not respond. However, responsiveness did not elicit more positive evaluations toward the VH (likeability and emotional connectedness). This study is an integral first step in establishing how and when affective and cognitive components of evaluations during social interactions diverge. Importantly, the findings suggest that feeling copresence with VH in MR is partially determined by the VHs’ response to events in the actual physical environment shared by both interactants.</p></div><div><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and mixed reality (MR) hardware have enabled what industry experts are dubbing as “the age of the virtual human” (<a href=\"#B55\">Titcombe et al., 2020</a>). Virtual humans (VH) are automated, computer-generated embodied agents capable of a wide range of human behavior (<a href=\"#B32\">Lucas et al., 2017</a>). Despite their artificial nature, VHs are largely perceived as social actors in part because of their ability to respond realistically to external cues, including users’ affective states (<a href=\"#B35\">Nass and Moon, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#B6\">Becker-Asano and Wachsmuth, 2010</a>). This capability has contributed to their integration into social environments, serving as educators in classrooms (<a href=\"#B31\">Li et al., 2016</a>), companions in homes (<a href=\"#B26\">Krämer et al., 2015</a>), and medical staff in hospitals (<a href=\"#B16\">Gunn et al., 2020</a>), among others. Yet, studies on the efficacy of VHs in such contexts have almost exclusively focused on how agent-specific factors, such as dialogue structure and appearance, contribute to desired social outcomes (e.g., see <a href=\"#B11\">Chattopadhyay et al., 2020</a>). This overlooks the role of the physical environment shared by interactants in shaping such outcomes (<a href=\"#B52\">Skjaeveland and Garling, 1997</a>), which becomes salient in MR-based scenarios. To address this gap, the current study examines how evaluations of VHs are influenced by their interactions with the physical environment during social engagements.</p><p>As virtual surrogates of humans, a VH’s effectiveness and social potential is contingent on factors foundational to human’s face-to-face (FtF) interactions (<a href=\"#B25\">Kopp and Bergmann, 2017</a>). Like humans, VHs must be able to detect, discern, and respond to a multitude of cues to understand and convey context-appropriate behaviors during an interaction (<a href=\"#B37\">Niewiadomski et al., 2010</a>). Cues broadly constitute any sensory information (e.g., colors, setting, and dialogue) accessible in a communication environment (see <a href=\"#B59\">Xu and Liao, 2020</a> for a review). Research to date primarily focuses on VHs’ detection and response to cues originating from the user, including the tone of voice (<a href=\"#B34\">Moridis and Economides, 2012</a>), facial expression, and posture (<a href=\"#B56\">Vinayagamoorthy et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#B19\">Karg et al., 2013</a>). At present, there is limited knowledge on how and when VHs can and should attend to cues originating from the user’s environment, which include cues within the immediate social context (e.g., pointing toward an object) as well as those outside (e.g., a phone ringing). These cues can provide important contextual meaning to a user’s behavior and can help shape context-appropriate behavior from the VH’s perspective. In this study, we have examined what we call <em>contextual responsiveness</em>: a VH’s capacity to detect and respond to cues occurring in the shared space between the user and the VH.</p><p>Contextual responsiveness may be an important design feature of VHs’ social and affective behavior toward users in MR because, unlike in virtual reality (VR), a VH is displayed in a user’s existing physical environment. As such, from a user perspective, the VH seems co-located in their physical space akin to FtF interactions, potentially rousing expectations about how the VH should behave and communicate given its access to contextual information in the shared space. While previous work has shown that human expectations of VH behavior vary based on factors such as VH appearance and task goals (<a href=\"#B10\">Burgoon et al., 2016</a>), a question that has been largely unexplored to date is whether and how a VH in MR—given situational awareness <em>via</em> real-world sensors—should respond to events and objects in the shared space (i.e., the user’s physical space).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that a VH’s nonverbal behaviors toward users can yield profound cognitive and affective impacts (<a href=\"#B5\">Beale and Creed, 2009</a>). For example, interactions with embodied agents that exhibited nonverbal feedback such as gestures were shown to engender more favorable evaluations (<a href=\"#B7\">Bergmann et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#B27\">Krämer et al., 2013</a>) and increase a sense of realism (e.g., <a href=\"#B15\">Garau et al., 2005</a>). Conversely, other works have shown that the absence of responsiveness to users can lead to unfavorable evaluations of a VH (e.g., <a href=\"#B51\">Skarbez et al., 2011</a>). Collectively, this work implies an expectancy of human-like responses from the VH to the user. Given that social interactions seldom exist in a vacuum, this expectation presumably extends to the shared environment such that the presence of contextual responsiveness may affect people’s feelings and beliefs about the VH and the social interaction.</p><p>One social interaction outcome that may be affected by a VH’s contextual responsiveness is social presence, or the subjective sense of “being with” another person (<a href=\"#B39\">Oh et al., 2018</a>). Social presence is an important factor in technology-mediated communication as it 1) contributes to the perception of artificial entities as social beings and 2) is associated with favorable outcomes such as enjoyment and social influence (cf. <a href=\"#B39\">Oh et al., 2018</a>). While there is limited consensus on the conceptualization and measurement of social presence (<a href=\"#B42\">Parker et al., 1978</a>; <a href=\"#B4\">Bailenson et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#B38\">Nowak, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#B8\">Biocca et al., 2003</a>), for the purposes of this study, we delineate social presence across two dimensions: copresence and connectedness. Copresence is characterized by a sense of being in the same space as another human, virtual, or otherwise, as well as the perception of mutual awareness and attention from others (<a href=\"#B60\">Zhao, 2003</a>). Connectedness refers to affective and relational evaluations of the VH, such as interpersonal closeness and mutual understanding; it has conceptual overlap with affinity, intimacy, immediacy, and attentiveness (cf. <a href=\"#B33\">Manstead et al., 2012</a>, p. 149).</p><p>From a theoretical standpoint, a VH’s contextual responsiveness is likely to influence copresence as it signals awareness of being in the same space with the user; a VH’s response to an event in the user’s physical space may help suspend the disbelief that the space is not actually shared and the VH is not really there with them. Should a VH not respond to events or objects in the shared space, a user may fail to sustain the illusion that the VH is copresent with them. Indeed, emerging work suggests that a VH’s contextual responsiveness to cues in a user’s physical space affects their copresence in MR. For example, when interacting with a virtual character in MR, users rated the experience as less plausible and felt a lower sense of spatial presence",

In order to accomplish that goal we employ networks, research, and stories\ngenerated from our work with a wide variety of external partners. Over the past months, we’ve\nbeen engaged in a process of evaluating and mapping the way we communicate and generate\ninsights and knowledge and the ways in which our partners contribute, perceive, and share in that\nprocess. In particular, we are interested in how we can create new processes we call feedback\nloops that can aid us in including our partners in more meaningful collaborations, developing\nsolutions that are better targeted to the audiences they are intended for, and elevating the voices,\nneeds, and excellence of the members of school communities.

During the course of this work, Digital Promise\ncame to define feedback loops as:\nContained within this definition\nare the criteria that make feed\u0002back loops unique and which\ncan be used to analyze and build\nfeedback loops in your own\norganization.\nWe see feedback loops as\npurposeful; they are intended\nto address problems of practice\nor better prepare the solutions\nto those problems to be taken\nup by the intended community.\nFeedback loops may not always\nbe intentionally designed toward\nthis end (i.e., they may occur\norganically), but they occur\nbecause a need has arisen.\nParticipant Participant\nBidirectional\ninteraction that\ntransforms\nknowledge, actions\nor goals\nAn interaction between two or more parties that is purposeful,\nbidirectional, and iterative and transforms the knowledge, actions,\nor goals of the engaged parties.\nFeedback Loops: Mapping Transformative Interactions in Education Innovation | 5\nWe envision feedback loops as bidirectional interactions; the flow of information and knowledge in\nfeedback loops moves in both directions for the involved parties. In contrast, simple feedback systems, such\nas a survey, tend to send information from one party to another in one direction only.\nFeedback loops are iterative; the loops themselves are in flux and non-fixed, and the parties engaged in\nthese loops are frequently changing the nature and process of the loops through their interactions.\nFeedback loops are transformative; through the iterative process of the loops, new knowledge is created,\nnew actions are taken, or new goals for the collaborative work emerge for parties in the loop.\nFeedback systems may contain one or more of these characteristics, while feedback loops feature all\nfour. Feedback systems are analogous to user or public opinion research in that they attempt to establish\nsentiment about a product or process and use that in its improvement and redesign. These are valuable\napproaches and can lead to significant increases in the impact of a product. Feedback loops, as we have\nconceived them, result in not only improvement in outputs, but create direct benefits for all participants.\nConsider a school district that is preparing to complete a curriculum adoption for their elementary schools.\nIn alignment with their strategic plan, they want to better connect with the parents in their school commu\u0002nity and decide to include parents in the selection of their new textbooks. As they go through their adoption\nprocess, they invite a few interested parents into meetings with the textbook vendors, and like their teacher\nselection committees, offer them a vote on which textbook they should adopt. This is feedback; the parents\ntell the district what they desire, and the district considers it as they make their choice. However, to what\nextent was the parents’ participation in this process valuable to the decision made? Did parents have a\nclear understanding of how their feedback might impact their child’s learning? Was the process valuable in\nstrengthening parents’ understanding of how their child learns and the ways in which their school supports\nthat? In this scenario, creating feedback loops could lead to a better outcome for the involved parties.\nTo create a situation that is bidirectional, iterative, and transformative, one could reimagine the ways that\nthe district, teachers, and parents interact. Instead of a simple voting process after the vendor presentations,\nthe district could create small teams of teachers and parents. In these teams, teachers could help build\ncapacity in the parents to better understand how curriculum is implemented and its effect on the class\u0002room, while parents could provide insight into how textbook materials might be used at home when work\nis assigned. This transformation and new knowledge constitutes a feedback loop, and through that process\nboth the teachers and parents would be better informed and prepared to choose a curricular offering. To\nfurther the improvement, the district could shift away from a simple voting process and into a series of\nlistening sessions with the teacher/parent teams where concerns and desires are highlighted and moved\ninto another round of discussions which inform the final selection. This iteration and change are hallmarks\nof a feedback loop in flux and have potential to create a process that is better informed by the needs of the\nschool community while building partnership and belonging.\nThrough the work undertaken at Digital Promise, we’ve been able to identify common patterns within our\nown feedback loops. Generally, we see patterns in participants and the roles they play and in the structures\nemployed to create the feedback loops.\nFeedback Loops: Mapping Transformative Interactions in Education Innovation | 6\nParticipants\nBroadly speaking, participants are the entities that interact in feedback loops through the generation and\npassing of knowledge. These participants can be individuals or groups of individuals that represent specific\nperspectives or expertise and whose skills and knowledge contribute to the goals of the feedback loop.\nThere are also administrative roles in feedback loops for participants–those who coordinate work and\noutputs, facilitate knowledge transmission, and otherwise maintain the loop as it evolves. Participants may\ncycle on and off of a feedback loop as it iterates.\nReferring back to our definition of feedback loops–an interaction between two or more parties that is\npurposeful, bidirectional, and iterative and transforms the knowledge, actions, or goals of the engaged\nparties–it is important to note that there may be participants in a feedback loop who are not the definitional\n",

From business-driven extreme programming teams to knowledge-worker cells, the potential of proactively managing the implicit and explicit knowledge that emerges from work and interaction has been widely recognized. But as knowledge management has progressively distinguished itself from the traditional fields of data and information management, its proponents have learned that knowledge is a difficult and challenging thing to manage. The discipline of knowledge management reflects this difficulty in its broad philosophical base and the range of approaches, from technological ones based on information management infrastructure through to sociotechnical ones that measure and develop knowledge capital [<a href=\"#R7\">7</a>, <a href=\"#R12\">12</a>].</p>\n<p><b><i>Knowledge is a personal thing.</i></b> We take the view that knowledge comes from a situated, personal and internalized experience of the world. Far from being reducible to information schemas or templates, knowledge emerges from the combination of personal skill, expertise, perception, history, and constructive memory. In its most basic form, knowledge is internalized know-how, the ability to tacitly know—in any particular context—what needs doing and how it should be done. It is developed whenever the individual applies his or her concepts, interpretations, and assumed conceptual relationships to the set of commonly observed phenomena in the world.</p>\n<p>So while we can communicate data in the form of events and messages (information) formed using syntactic and semantic conventions, knowledge is a far more elusive property that does not quantify easily, especially in our increasingly complex, heterogeneous work and personal environments. What one person perceives as knowledge may be bland information in another’s eyes. So if we cannot reify knowledge objectively in databases or build tools that handle knowledge directly, a promising alternative is to capture and manage information in such a way that it supports how knowledge is made explicit and transferred. In doing so, we focus on devising techniques to improve the process where information is converted to knowledge. Here, we explore the use of patterns [<a href=\"#R1\">1</a>, <a href=\"#R3\">3</a>] as a powerful mechanism for this information-to-knowledge conversion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">Back to Top</a></p>\n<h3>Patterns as Knowledge Media</h3>\n<p>To illustrate the potential of using patterns for knowledge management, consider the pattern <i>Sell Now, Resource Later</i> (see the <a href=\"#UT1\">table</a> here), an example of a pattern from a pattern language that might describe the corporate culture of a consulting or professional services firm. It illustrates some of the key features that differentiate the patterns approach from other knowledge management or design transfer techniques. We will contrast some of these later, but for now, look through the syntax and structure of <i>Sell Now, Resource Later</i> as described in the table to consider the intent of the pattern. It describes in no uncertain terms the company’s resource scheduling strategy and operational policy, and does this in an open way, allowing the reader to deconstruct this knowledge to its component parts and then reconstruct the solution’s rationale. The elements of the pattern (context, problem, forces, solution, rationale, resulting context, related patterns) allow its readers to draw together a judgment as to its usefulness, appropriateness, and applicability in different contexts. <i>Sell Now, Resource Later</i> makes a tacit optimistic resource allocation strategy for the consulting organization explicit and accessible.</p>\n<p><b><i>Organizational benefits.</i></b> For the organization, this pattern’s strategic and operational value is clear. Supervisors find great value in being able to convey useful resource allocation strategies to first-time managers or new employees in a form that is informal and easy to comprehend. As a technique for expressing knowledge, the process of identifying patterns serves to make explicit and validate tacit knowledge, so that it can be subsequently reapplied and combined with other pieces of knowledge. Over time, this extends the boundaries of the organization’s knowledge, while encouraging ineffective ‘knowledge’ to be identified. As a tool for cultural reinforcement, the pattern attaches a label (<i>Sell Now, Resource Later</i>) to an organization’s strategy that has been proven and should be followed. The creation of a company-specific vocabulary of pattern names and the association of each with a desired behavior provides a systematic counterpoint to the management of company culture than ad hoc or opportunistic ones. The applicability of patterns as a technique for knowledge management rests on two key characteristics—knowledge capture and knowledge communication, and it is these benefits that we believe patterns can bring to the discipline of knowledge management.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">Back to Top</a></p>\n<h3>Patterns in the World</h3>\n<p>Because of the personal and perceptual dimensions of knowledge, the highest return-on-investment in knowledge management effort is frequently realized by concentrating on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Presenting and structuring information in such a way that it supports reification of knowledge and knowledge-enacting behaviors in people rather than artifacts;</li>\n<li>Building conceptual frameworks that allow the sharing of ideas and abstractions between people working in the same conceptual spaces; and</li>\n<li>Identifying individuals or groups who possess critical knowledge, and then supporting these people appropriately with the right techniques and resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Patterns are an excellent candidate technique to meet these requirements—they provide a flexible but structured informational template, they use simple but expressive everyday statements, they are deliberate and instructive while providing transparent reasoning, and they can convey business structure, cultural values, and strategies at many levels of an organization simultaneously.</p>\n<p><b><i>The impact of patterns.</i></b> The pattern languages and catalogs of Gamma [<a href=\"#R4\">4</a>], Buschmann [<a href=\"#R2\">2</a>], Rising [<a href=\"#R9\">9</a>] and other authors have altered the way software developers speak and think about design. Patterns like Observer, Visitor, and Iterator [<a href=\"#R4\">4</a>] have lifted the level of abstraction in the design discourse, ensuring rapid exchange and transfer of proven solutions between designers. The application of patterns to the problems of structuring software teams is less well-known but equally well-regarded—Coplien and Harrison’s organizational pattern language encapsulates extensively researched knowledge of how the world’s most productive and healthy software teams operate.</p>\n<p>The object-oriented world and other domains where patterns have been successfully applied [<a href=\"#R10\">10</a>] demonstrate the capture, transfer, and management of design knowledge. The next context for pattern adoption—organizations and global business communities—presents a vast opportunity. But to achieve the transition from a system design practice to an organizational and business practice, patterns need to fit the ways that organizational knowledge is understood, valued, and managed. To be acceptable, useful, and usable, patterns and the knowledge-sharing they enable must fit comfortably with organizational and business models of knowledge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">Back to Top</a></p>\n<h3>Fitting a Model of Knowledge</h3>\n<p>The concepts of tacit and explicit knowledge [<a href=\"#R8\">8</a>] are central to knowledge management theory and practice. Nonaka and Takeuchi [<a href=\"#R7\">7</a>] present a model for the interplay between these two phases of knowledge, as depicted in the <a href=\"#UF1\">figure</a> on the left.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">Back to Top</a></p>\n<h3>Tacit to Tacit Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Tacit knowledge underpins classic expert behavior—the uncharted, unpredictable combination of skill, information, expertise, experience, and judgment that work together in a seemingly ad hoc way in the minds and actions of an expert surgeon, lawyer, executive, architect, designer, navigator, writer, consultant, or programmer. It is common for such experts to be unable to explain their methods or rationalize their actions. Tacit knowledge of this kind is both critical to expert performance and impossible to predictably manage, and is typically only passed on by craft-like mentoring of apprentices over many years. Some professions—for example, law, medicine, and architecture—prefer to keep it this way, and have a long history of knowledge preservation and even protectionism. Others, like the engineering disciplines, are more altruistic about knowledge exchange.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">Back to Top</a></p>\n<h3>Tacit to Explicit Knowledge</h3>\n<p><b><i>Mining patterns.</i></b> A valuable insight derived from knowledge management is to make tacit knowledge explicit, allowing it to be analyzed and critiqued, learned, shared, and combined. Several aspects of the patterns approach support this phase transition. To beg",

It illustrates some of the key features that differentiate the patterns approach from other knowledge management or design transfer techniques. We will contrast some of these later, but for now, look through the syntax and structure of <i>Sell Now, Resource Later</i> as described in the table to consider the intent of the pattern. It describes in no uncertain terms the company’s resource scheduling strategy and operational policy, and does this in an open way, allowing the reader to deconstruct this knowledge to its component parts and then reconstruct the solution’s rationale. The elements of the pattern (context, problem, forces, solution, rationale, resulting context, related patterns) allow its readers to draw together a judgment as to its usefulness, appropriateness, and applicability in different contexts. <i>Sell Now, Resource Later</i> makes a tacit optimistic resource allocation strategy for the consulting organization explicit and accessible.</p>\n<p><b><i>Organizational benefits.</i></b> For the organization, this pattern’s strategic and operational value is clear. Supervisors find great value in being able to convey useful resource allocation strategies to first-time managers or new employees in a form that is informal and easy to comprehend. As a technique for expressing knowledge, the process of identifying patterns serves to make explicit and validate tacit knowledge, so that it can be subsequently reapplied and combined with other pieces of knowledge. Over time, this extends the boundaries of the organization’s knowledge, while encouraging ineffective ‘knowledge’ to be identified. As a tool for cultural reinforcement, the pattern attaches a label (<i>Sell Now, Resource Later</i>) to an organization’s strategy that has been proven and should be followed. The creation of a company-specific vocabulary of pattern names and the association of each with a desired behavior provides a systematic counterpoint to the management of company culture than ad hoc or opportunistic ones. The applicability of patterns as a technique for knowledge management rests on two key characteristics—knowledge capture and knowledge communication, and it is these benefits that we believe patterns can bring to the discipline of knowledge management.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">Back to Top</a></p>\n<h3>Patterns in the World</h3>\n<p>Because of the personal and perceptual dimensions of knowledge, the highest return-on-investment in knowledge management effort is frequently realized by concentrating on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Presenting and structuring information in such a way that it supports reification of knowledge and knowledge-enacting behaviors in people rather than artifacts;</li>\n<li>Building conceptual frameworks that allow the sharing of ideas and abstractions between people working in the same conceptual spaces; and</li>\n<li>Identifying individuals or groups who possess critical knowledge, and then supporting these people appropriately with the right techniques and resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Patterns are an excellent candidate technique to meet these requirements—they provide a flexible but structured informational template, they use simple but expressive everyday statements, they are deliberate and instructive while providing transparent reasoning, and they can convey business structure, cultural values, and strategies at many levels of an organization simultaneously.</p>\n<p><b><i>The impact of patterns.</i></b> The pattern languages and catalogs of Gamma [<a href=\"#R4\">4</a>], Buschmann [<a href=\"#R2\">2</a>], Rising [<a href=\"#R9\">9</a>] and other authors have altered the way software developers speak and think about design. Patterns like Observer, Visitor, and Iterator [<a href=\"#R4\">4</a>] have lifted the level of abstraction in the design discourse, ensuring rapid exchange and transfer of proven solutions between designers. The application of patterns to the problems of structuring software teams is less well-known but equally well-regarded—Coplien and Harrison’s organizational pattern language encapsulates extensively researched knowledge of how the world’s most productive and healthy software teams operate.</p>\n<p>The object-oriented world and other domains where patterns have been successfully applied [<a href=\"#R10\">10</a>] demonstrate the capture, transfer, and management of design knowledge. The next context for pattern adoption—organizations and global business communities—presents a vast opportunity. But to achieve the transition from a system design practice to an organizational and business practice, patterns need to fit the ways that organizational knowledge is understood, valued, and managed. To be acceptable, useful, and usable, patterns and the knowledge-sharing they enable must fit comfortably with organizational and business models of knowledge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">Back to Top</a></p>\n<h3>Fitting a Model of Knowledge</h3>\n<p>The concepts of tacit and explicit knowledge [<a href=\"#R8\">8</a>] are central to knowledge management theory and practice. Nonaka and Takeuchi [<a href=\"#R7\">7</a>] present a model for the interplay between these two phases of knowledge, as depicted in the <a href=\"#UF1\">figure</a> on the left.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">Back to Top</a></p>\n<h3>Tacit to Tacit Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Tacit knowledge underpins classic expert behavior—the uncharted, unpredictable combination of skill, information, expertise, experience, and judgment that work together in a seemingly ad hoc way in the minds and actions of an expert surgeon, lawyer, executive, architect, designer, navigator, writer, consultant, or programmer. It is common for such experts to be unable to explain their methods or rationalize their actions. Tacit knowledge of this kind is both critical to expert performance and impossible to predictably manage, and is typically only passed on by craft-like mentoring of apprentices over many years. Some professions—for example, law, medicine, and architecture—prefer to keep it this way, and have a long history of knowledge preservation and even protectionism. Others, like the engineering disciplines, are more altruistic about knowledge exchange.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">Back to Top</a></p>\n<h3>Tacit to Explicit Knowledge</h3>\n<p><b><i>Mining patterns.</i></b> A valuable insight derived from knowledge management is to make tacit knowledge explicit, allowing it to be analyzed and critiqued, learned, shared, and combined. Several aspects of the patterns approach support this phase transition. To beg",

We propose a mechanistic explanation of how working memories are built from the latent representations of visual knowledge and can then be reconstructed. The proposed model, Memory for Latent Representations (MLR), features a variational autoencoder with an architecture that corresponds broadly to the human visual system and an activation-based binding pool of neurons that binds items’ attributes to tokenized representations. The simulation results revealed that the shapes of familiar items can be encoded and retrieved efficiently from latents in higher levels of the visual hierarchy. On the other hand, novel patterns that are completely outside the training set can be stored from a single exposure using only latents from early layers of the visual system. Moreover, a given stimulus in working memory can have multiple codes, representing specific visual features such as shape or color, in addition to categorical information. Finally, we validated our model by testing a series of predictions against behavioral results obtained from WM tasks. The model provides a compelling demonstration of how visual knowledge yields compact visual representation for efficient memory encoding.</p></div><div><h2>Introduction</h2><p>In the study of memory, working memory (WM) is thought to be responsible for temporarily holding and manipulating information. This capacity to control information is thought to be a keystone of our ability to perform complex cognitive operations. Characterizing WM is an integral part of the birth of cognitive psychology, as decades of research have centered on the question of discovering the capacity and nature of this short-term memory system (e.g., <a href=\"#ref-63\">Miller, 1956</a>; when the term <em>short-term memory</em> was favored).</p><p>One of the central issues in many discussions over the structure of WM is how it is affected by previously learned knowledge (i.e., long-term memory; <a href=\"#ref-5\">Baddeley &amp; Hitch, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#ref-23\">Cowan, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#ref-26\">Cowan, 2019</a>; <a href=\"#ref-29\">Ericsson &amp; Kintsch, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#ref-70\">Norris, 2017</a>; <a href=\"#ref-72\">Oberauer, 2009</a>). Knowledge that emerges from long-term familiarity with particular shapes or statistically common featural combinations enables us to recognize and remember complex objects (i.e., the prototypical shape of a car, or the strokes that comprise a digit). It is widely acknowledged that such information is crucial for building WM representations (<a href=\"#ref-24\">Cowan, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#ref-12\">Brady, Konkle &amp; Alvarez, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#ref-72\">Oberauer, 2009</a>) but there has been little attempt, if any, to mechanistically implement the role of visual knowledge in WM models in spite of abundant behavioral research in this domain (<a href=\"#ref-1\">Alvarez &amp; Cavanagh, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#ref-17\">Chen &amp; Cowan, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#ref-18\">2009</a>; Hulme, Maughen &amp; Brown, 1991; <a href=\"#ref-68\">Ngiam, et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"#ref-68\">Ngiam, Brissenden &amp; Awh, 2019</a>; <a href=\"#ref-95\">Yu et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#ref-96\">Zhang &amp; Simon, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#ref-97\">Zimmer &amp; Fischer, 2020</a>). For instance, <a href=\"#ref-1\">Alvarez &amp; Cavanagh (2004)</a> demonstrated that the number of items stored in WM is affected by stimulus complexity, with particularly poor performance for Chinese characters. <a href=\"#ref-97\">Zimmer &amp; Fischer (2020)</a> expanded on this by showing that the difficulty in remembering Chinese characters is specific to individuals who are not readers of the language. That is to say, the WM capacity for Chinese characters is higher if observers have already been trained on those stimuli. Moreover, Brady, Stormer &amp; Alvarez (2016) have demonstrated that evident memory capacity for natural images is higher than memory capacity for simple colors, as natural images are the stimuli that people have had the most visual experience with compared to artificial shapes. These results can be extended to verbal memory, as performance on immediate recall of a list of words is limited by the number pre-learned chunks represented in long-term knowledge (<a href=\"#ref-17\">Chen &amp; Cowan, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#ref-42\">Hulme, Maughan &amp; Brown, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#ref-43\">Hulme et al., 2003</a>).</p><p>Even prior to these findings, there has been extensive theoretical discussion of the necessity to link WM to long-term memory representations. Among the earliest memory schemes was the <a href=\"#ref-2\">Atkinson &amp; Shiffrin (1968)</a> model of memory in which representations in long-term memory could be transferred to a short-term storage if needed. Later, <a href=\"#ref-5\">Baddeley and Hitch (1974)</a> proposed the multicomponent model of WM. In this model the short-term storage for visual information (i.e., visuospatial sketchpad) was shown to be dependent on visual semantics and episodic long-term memory with a bidirectional arrow indicating the flow of information (<a href=\"#ref-4\">Baddeley, 2000</a>). This idea is also carried by theories of activated long-term memory account (<a href=\"#ref-23\">Cowan 1988</a>, <a href=\"#ref-24\">1999</a>, <a href=\"#ref-25\">2001</a>; <a href=\"#ref-29\">Ericsson &amp; Kintsch, 1995</a>) which is also discussed by <a href=\"#ref-72\">Oberauer (2009)</a>. In this account (also known as the embedded process framework), WM representations are built by activating pre-existing representations within the long-term memory.</p><p>The above accounts (i.e., multiple components and activated long-term memory) provide a venue toward a WM mechanism integrated with long-term knowledge, but their lack of computational specificity has made it challenging to make testable predictions of <em>how</em> knowledge reflects in WM mechanisms. This includes addressing questions such as “How do we form rapid memories of novel configurations (<a href=\"#ref-53\">Lake et al., 2011</a>)?” and “Why is WM capacity higher for familiar items (<a href=\"#ref-95\">Yu et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#ref-96\">Zhang &amp; Simon, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#ref-97\">Zimmer &amp; Fischer, 2020</a>)?”</p><p>To fill this gap, we implemented a computational WM model in conjunction with a visual knowledge system named Memory for Latent Representations (MLR). The proposed model simulates how latent representations of items embedded in the visual knowledge hierarchy are encoded into WM depending on their level of familiarity. Subsequently, the encoded items in WM can be retrieved by reactivating those same latent representations in the visual knowledge system. This paper outlines a candidate model for storing and retrieving visual memories of complex shapes in a dedicated pool of neurons and provides empirical validation of the flexibility of WM.</p><div><h3>The new MLR model of working memory</h3><p>The MLR model takes advantage of recent innovations in generative deep learning models to represent and reconstruct visual stimuli that are embedded in the visual knowledge.

We propose a mechanistic explanation of how working memories are built from the latent representations of visual knowledge and can then be reconstructed. The proposed model, Memory for Latent Representations (MLR), features a variational autoencoder with an architecture that corresponds broadly to the human visual system and an activation-based binding pool of neurons that binds items’ attributes to tokenized representations. The simulation results revealed that the shapes of familiar items can be encoded and retrieved efficiently from latents in higher levels of the visual hierarchy. On the other hand, novel patterns that are completely outside the training set can be stored from a single exposure using only latents from early layers of the visual system. Moreover, a given stimulus in working memory can have multiple codes, representing specific visual features such as shape or color, in addition to categorical information. Finally, we validated our model by testing a series of predictions against behavioral results obtained from WM tasks. The model provides a compelling demonstration of how visual knowledge yields compact visual representation for efficient memory encoding.</p></div><div><h2>Introduction</h2><p>In the study of memory, working memory (WM) is thought to be responsible for temporarily holding and manipulating information. This capacity to control information is thought to be a keystone of our ability to perform complex cognitive operations. Characterizing WM is an integral part of the birth of cognitive psychology, as decades of research have centered on the question of discovering the capacity and nature of this short-term memory system (e.g., <a href=\"#ref-63\">Miller, 1956</a>; when the term <em>short-term memory</em> was favored).</p><p>One of the central issues in many discussions over the structure of WM is how it is affected by previously learned knowledge (i.e., long-term memory; <a href=\"#ref-5\">Baddeley &amp; Hitch, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#ref-23\">Cowan, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#ref-26\">Cowan, 2019</a>; <a href=\"#ref-29\">Ericsson &amp; Kintsch, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#ref-70\">Norris, 2017</a>; <a href=\"#ref-72\">Oberauer, 2009</a>). Knowledge that emerges from long-term familiarity with particular shapes or statistically common featural combinations enables us to recognize and remember complex objects (i.e., the prototypical shape of a car, or the strokes that comprise a digit). It is widely acknowledged that such information is crucial for building WM representations (<a href=\"#ref-24\">Cowan, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#ref-12\">Brady, Konkle &amp; Alvarez, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#ref-72\">Oberauer, 2009</a>) but there has been little attempt, if any, to mechanistically implement the role of visual knowledge in WM models in spite of abundant behavioral research in this domain (<a href=\"#ref-1\">Alvarez &amp; Cavanagh, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#ref-17\">Chen &amp; Cowan, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#ref-18\">2009</a>; Hulme, Maughen &amp; Brown, 1991; <a href=\"#ref-68\">Ngiam, et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"#ref-68\">Ngiam, Brissenden &amp; Awh, 2019</a>; <a href=\"#ref-95\">Yu et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#ref-96\">Zhang &amp; Simon, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#ref-97\">Zimmer &amp; Fischer, 2020</a>). For instance, <a href=\"#ref-1\">Alvarez &amp; Cavanagh (2004)</a> demonstrated that the number of items stored in WM is affected by stimulus complexity, with particularly poor performance for Chinese characters. <a href=\"#ref-97\">Zimmer &amp; Fischer (2020)</a> expanded on this by showing that the difficulty in remembering Chinese characters is specific to individuals who are not readers of the language. That is to say, the WM capacity for Chinese characters is higher if observers have already been trained on those stimuli. Moreover, Brady, Stormer &amp; Alvarez (2016) have demonstrated that evident memory capacity for natural images is higher than memory capacity for simple colors, as natural images are the stimuli that people have had the most visual experience with compared to artificial shapes. These results can be extended to verbal memory, as performance on immediate recall of a list of words is limited by the number pre-learned chunks represented in long-term knowledge (<a href=\"#ref-17\">Chen &amp; Cowan, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#ref-42\">Hulme, Maughan &amp; Brown, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#ref-43\">Hulme et al., 2003</a>).</p><p>Even prior to these findings, there has been extensive theoretical discussion of the necessity to link WM to long-term memory representations. Among the earliest memory schemes was the <a href=\"#ref-2\">Atkinson &amp; Shiffrin (1968)</a> model of memory in which representations in long-term memory could be transferred to a short-term storage if needed. Later, <a href=\"#ref-5\">Baddeley and Hitch (1974)</a> proposed the multicomponent model of WM. In this model the short-term storage for visual information (i.e., visuospatial sketchpad) was shown to be dependent on visual semantics and episodic long-term memory with a bidirectional arrow indicating the flow of information (<a href=\"#ref-4\">Baddeley, 2000</a>). This idea is also carried by theories of activated long-term memory account (<a href=\"#ref-23\">Cowan 1988</a>, <a href=\"#ref-24\">1999</a>, <a href=\"#ref-25\">2001</a>; <a href=\"#ref-29\">Ericsson &amp; Kintsch, 1995</a>) which is also discussed by <a href=\"#ref-72\">Oberauer (2009)</a>. In this account (also known as the embedded process framework), WM representations are built by activating pre-existing representations within the long-term memory.</p><p>The above accounts (i.e., multiple components and activated long-term memory) provide a venue toward a WM mechanism integrated with long-term knowledge, but their lack of computational specificity has made it challenging to make testable predictions of <em>how</em> knowledge reflects in WM mechanisms. This includes addressing questions such as “How do we form rapid memories of novel configurations (<a href=\"#ref-53\">Lake et al., 2011</a>)?” and “Why is WM capacity higher for familiar items (<a href=\"#ref-95\">Yu et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#ref-96\">Zhang &amp; Simon, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#ref-97\">Zimmer &amp; Fischer, 2020</a>)?”</p><p>To fill this gap, we implemented a computational WM model in conjunction with a visual knowledge system named Memory for Latent Representations (MLR). The proposed model simulates how latent representations of items embedded in the visual knowledge hierarchy are encoded into WM depending on their level of familiarity. Subsequently, the encoded items in WM can be retrieved by reactivating those same latent representations in the visual knowledge system. This paper outlines a candidate model for storing and retrieving visual memories of complex shapes in a dedicated pool of neurons and provides empirical validation of the flexibility of WM.</p><div><h3>The new MLR model of working memory</h3><p>The MLR model takes advantage of recent innovations in generative deep learning models to represent and reconstruct visual stimuli that are embedded in the visual knowledge. Rather than storing unidimensional attributes as in other recent working memory models (<a href=\"#ref-10\">Bouchacourt &amp; Buschman, 2019</a>; <a href=\"#ref-84\">Schneegans &amp; Bays, 2017</a>; <a href=\"#ref-58\">Lin &amp; Oberauer, 2019</a>; <a href=\"#ref-86\">Swan &amp; Wyble, 2014</a>), MLR can encode and reconstruct arbitrary shape attributes, such as a particular handwritten digit, or an article of clothing.

        "text": "<div><div>\n<article>\n<div><h4><strong><span>Let’s get a handle first on what we know about memory and recall.</span></strong></h4>\n<p><span>There are two basic types of explicit, or declarative, memory. First, short term or working memory. Think of this as the focus of current attention, or what you are actively thinking about right now. Second, long term memory which is broken down further into semantic memory (facts) and episodic memory (specific events).</span></p>\n<p><span>Within explicit, or declarative, memory, there are three basic stages of memory processing. <strong>Encoding</strong> is the process of forming new memories. <strong>Storage</strong> comes next, and is the process of information maintenance. And finally there is the process of gaining access to stored knowledge, referred to as <strong>retrieval</strong>. For learning to take place, as we categorize it in this sense, it requires that the information that is processed is then committed to memory and that the student can pull it back out when it’s needed (let alone apply it to a novel circumstance through adaptation and abstraction).</span></p>\n<p><span>By examining each part of memory and recall from encoding to storage to retrieval, we get a clear sense of how best to optimize this process for our students.</span></p>\n<p><span>To make encoding a powerful process, it’s necessary to recognize that memories are NOT stored as faithful recordings, like a book you can pull off a shelf to share again as needed in their exact original form. Instead, each new memory is integrated into our existing body of knowledge - coloring and being colored by other memories. Therefore, the most robust memories are formed through elaboration and organization where learners:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>process the new information as deeply as possible,</span></li>\n<li><span>maximize connections with what is already known, and</span></li>\n<li><span>situate new knowledge into an existing framework.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>The challenge with storage is that once something has made it into long-term memory, it tends to remain stored, but not necessarily always accessible. The challenge here is not one of capacity. In fact, our capacity for storing new memories is essentially unlimited, and more so, organized learning appears to create additional capacity. However, the ability to access a given memory typically declines over time, primarily due to interference caused by the acquisition of new, competing memories. Do not let this sour your hope of learners remembering what was learned in your class.

And finally there is the process of gaining access to stored knowledge, referred to as <strong>retrieval</strong>. For learning to take place, as we categorize it in this sense, it requires that the information that is processed is then committed to memory and that the student can pull it back out when it’s needed (let alone apply it to a novel circumstance through adaptation and abstraction).</span></p>\n<p><span>By examining each part of memory and recall from encoding to storage to retrieval, we get a clear sense of how best to optimize this process for our students.</span></p>\n<p><span>To make encoding a powerful process, it’s necessary to recognize that memories are NOT stored as faithful recordings, like a book you can pull off a shelf to share again as needed in their exact original form. Instead, each new memory is integrated into our existing body of knowledge - coloring and being colored by other memories. Therefore, the most robust memories are formed through elaboration and organization where learners:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>process the new information as deeply as possible,</span></li>\n<li><span>maximize connections with what is already known, and</span></li>\n<li><span>situate new knowledge into an existing framework.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>The challenge with storage is that once something has made it into long-term memory, it tends to remain stored, but not necessarily always accessible. The challenge here is not one of capacity. In fact, our capacity for storing new memories is essentially unlimited, and more so, organized learning appears to create additional capacity. However, the ability to access a given memory typically declines over time, primarily due to interference caused by the acquisition of new, competing memories. Do not let this sour your hope of learners remembering what was learned in your class. You can markedly increase the likelihood of students being able to recall a memory at a future time by strengthening it through retrieval.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Retrieval is an active reconstruction process, not a playback of a memory of an event, fact, concept, or process.

We develop a computational theory of memory modification, according to which modification of a memory trace occurs through classical associative learning, but which memory trace is eligible for modification depends on a structure learning mechanism that discovers the units of association by segmenting the stream of experience into statistically distinct clusters (latent causes). New memories are formed when the structure learning mechanism infers that a new latent cause underlies current sensory observations. By the same token, old memories are modified when old and new sensory observations are inferred to have been generated by the same latent cause. We derive this framework from probabilistic principles, and present a computational implementation.

For example, most people would expect a chocolate bar to taste good, because they have previously learned to associate chocolate with pleasure. When a surprising event occurs, such as tasting an unpalatable chocolate bar, the brain therefore faces a dilemma. Should it update the existing memory and overwrite the association between chocolate and pleasure? Or should it create an additional memory? In the latter case, the brain would form a new association between chocolate and displeasure that competes with, but does not overwrite, the original one between chocolate and pleasure.</p>\n<p>Previous studies have shown that surprising events tend to create new memories unless the existing memory is briefly reactivated before the surprising event occurs. In other words, retrieving old memories makes them more malleable. Gershman et al. have now developed a computational model for how the brain decides whether to update an old memory or create a new one. The idea at the heart of the model is that the brain will attempt to infer what caused the surprising event. The reason the chocolate bar tastes unpalatable, for example, might be because it was old and had spoiled. Every time the brain infers a new possible cause for a surprising event, it will create an additional memory to store this new set of expectations. In the future we will know that spoiled chocolate bars taste bad.</p>\n<p>However, if the brain cannot infer a new cause for the surprising event – because, for example, there appears to be nothing unusual about the unpalatable chocolate bar – it will instead opt to update the existing memory. The next time we buy a chocolate bar, we will have slightly lower expectations about how good it will taste. The dilemma of whether to update an existing memory or create a new one thus boils down to the question: is the surprising event the consequence of a new cause or an old one? This theory implies that retrieving a memory nudges the brain to infer that its associated cause is once again active and, since this is an old cause, it means that the memory will be eligible for updating.</p>\n<p>Many experiments have been performed on the topic of modifying memories, but this is the first computational model that offers a unifying explanation for the results. The next step is to work out how to apply the model, which is phrased in abstract terms, to networks of neurons that are more biologically realistic.</p>\n<p><span>\n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23763.002\">\nhttps://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23763.002\n</a>\n</span>\n</p></div>\n</section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n</header>\n<div>\n<p>In both humans and animals, memory retrieval is a significant learning event (<a href=\"#bib47\">Dudai, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib159\">Roediger and Butler, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib176\">Spear, 1973</a>). A memory’s strength and content can be modified immediately after retrieval, and this malleability is often more potent than new learning without retrieval. While this phenomenon is well-documented, its underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Does retrieval render the contents of the memory trace modifiable, does it affect the future accessibility of the memory trace, or both?</p>\n<p>We develop a computational theory that begins to address these questions. Central to our theory is the idea that memory is inferential in nature: Decisions about when to modify an old memory or form a new memory are guided by inferences about the <i>latent causes</i> of sensory data (<a href=\"#bib65\">Gershman et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib73\">2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib72\">2015</a>). Memories contain statistical information about inferred latent causes (when they are likely to occur, what sensory data they tend to generate). These statistics are retrieved and updated whenever a previously inferred latent cause is believed to have generated new sensory data. Conditions that promote the retrieval of a memory are, according to this account, precisely the conditions that promote the inference that the same previously inferred latent cause is once again active. If no previously inferred latent cause adequately predicts the current sensory data, then a new memory is formed. Thus, memory modification is intimately connected to the process of latent structure learning. We formalize this idea as a probabilistic model, and then demonstrate its explanatory power by simulating a wide range of post-retrieval memory modification phenomena.</p>\n<p>It is important to clarify at the outset that our theory is formulated at an abstract, cognitive level of analysis, in order to elucidate the design principles and algorithmic structure of memory. We do not make strong claims about biologically plausible implementation in realistic neurons, although we speculate about such an implementation in the Discussion. Addressing this question is a logical next step for this line of research.</p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h3>Retrieval-induced memory modification in pavlovian conditioning</h3>\n</header>\n<div>\n<p>While retrieval-induced memory modification has been documented in a variety of domains—including procedural (<a href=\"#bib28\">Censor et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib185\">Walker et al., 2003</a>), episodic (<a href=\"#bib91\">Hupbach et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Karpicke and Roediger, 2008</a>), and instrumental (<a href=\"#bib106\">Lee et al., 2006b</a>; <a href=\"#bib192\">Xue et al., 2012</a>) learning—we focus on Pavlovian conditioning, because it offers some of the most elementary and well-studied examples. During the acquisition phase of a typical Pavlovian conditioning experiment, a motivationally neutral conditional stimulus (CS; e.g., tone) is repeatedly paired with a motivationally reinforcing unconditional stimulus (US; e.g., a shock). This repeated pairing results in the animal producing a conditioned response (CR; e.g., freezing) to the CS. In a subsequent extinction phase, the CS is presented alone, and the animal gradually ceases to produce the CR. A final test phase, after some delay, probes the animal’s long-term memory of the CS-US relationship by presenting the CS alone.</p>\n<p>In a classic experiment using a Pavlovian fear conditioning task, <a href=\"#bib131\">Misanin et al. (1968)</a> found that electroconvulsive shock had no effect on a fear memory acquired a day previously; however, if the animal was briefly reexposed to the acquisition cue prior to electroconvulsive shock, the animal subsequently exhibited loss of fear. This finding was followed by numerous similar demonstrations of post-retrieval memory modification (see <a href=\"#bib158\">Riccio et al., 2006</a>, for a historical overview).</p>\n<p>Contemporary neuroscientific interest in this phenomenon was ignited by <a href=\"#bib134\">Nader et al. (2000)</a>, who showed that retrograde amnesia for an acquired fear memory could be produced by injection of a protein synthesis inhibitor (PSI) into the lateral nucleus of the amygdala shortly after reexposure to the acquisition cue. Subsequent studies have provided a detailed neural and behavioral characterization of post-retrieval memory modification, describing a large cast of molecular mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib181\">Tronson and Taylor, 2007</a>) and several boundary conditions on its occurrence (<a href=\"#bib47\">Dudai, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Duvarci and Nader, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib133\">Nader and Hardt, 2009</a>). For instance, it has been shown that stronger and older memories are harder to modify following retrieval (<a href=\"#bib179\">Suzuki et al., 2004</a>), and that the modification is cue-specific (<a href=\"#bib46\">Doyère et al., 2007</a>).</p>\n<p>Importantly, there is now evidence that memory modification can be obtained with a purely behavioral procedure. In particular, <a href=\"#bib132\">Monfils et al. (2009)</a> and <a href=\"#bib169\">Schiller et al. (2010)</a> showed, in rats and in humans, that reexposing a subject to the cue shortly (10 min to 1 hr) before extinction training is sufficient to reduce conditioned responding at test. This finding presents a deep puzzle for associative learning theory, since the cue reexposure is operationally an extinction trial and hence it is unclear what makes it special. One of our main goals will be to unravel this puzzle, showing how cue reexposure influences probabilistic beliefs about latent causes such that they are eligible for updating by the subsequent extinction training.</p>\n<p>This body of work has traditionally been understood as probing mechanisms of ‘reconsolidation’ (<a href=\"#bib134\">Nader et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib148\">Przybyslawski and Sara, 1997</a>)",

We propose a mechanistic explanation of how working memories are built from the latent representations of visual knowledge and can then be reconstructed. The proposed model, Memory for Latent Representations (MLR), features a variational autoencoder with an architecture that corresponds broadly to the human visual system and an activation-based binding pool of neurons that binds items’ attributes to tokenized representations. The simulation results revealed that the shapes of familiar items can be encoded and retrieved efficiently from latents in higher levels of the visual hierarchy. On the other hand, novel patterns that are completely outside the training set can be stored from a single exposure using only latents from early layers of the visual system. Moreover, a given stimulus in working memory can have multiple codes, representing specific visual features such as shape or color, in addition to categorical information. Finally, we validated our model by testing a series of predictions against behavioral results obtained from WM tasks.

This capacity to control information is thought to be a keystone of our ability to perform complex cognitive operations. Characterizing WM is an integral part of the birth of cognitive psychology, as decades of research have centered on the question of discovering the capacity and nature of this short-term memory system (e.g., <a href=\"#ref-63\">Miller, 1956</a>; when the term <em>short-term memory</em> was favored).</p><p>One of the central issues in many discussions over the structure of WM is how it is affected by previously learned knowledge (i.e., long-term memory; <a href=\"#ref-5\">Baddeley &amp; Hitch, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#ref-23\">Cowan, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#ref-26\">Cowan, 2019</a>; <a href=\"#ref-29\">Ericsson &amp; Kintsch, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#ref-70\">Norris, 2017</a>; <a href=\"#ref-72\">Oberauer, 2009</a>). Knowledge that emerges from long-term familiarity with particular shapes or statistically common featural combinations enables us to recognize and remember complex objects (i.e., the prototypical shape of a car, or the strokes that comprise a digit). It is widely acknowledged that such information is crucial for building WM representations (<a href=\"#ref-24\">Cowan, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#ref-12\">Brady, Konkle &amp; Alvarez, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#ref-72\">Oberauer, 2009</a>) but there has been little attempt, if any, to mechanistically implement the role of visual knowledge in WM models in spite of abundant behavioral research in this domain (<a href=\"#ref-1\">Alvarez &amp; Cavanagh, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#ref-17\">Chen &amp; Cowan, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#ref-18\">2009</a>; Hulme, Maughen &amp; Brown, 1991; <a href=\"#ref-68\">Ngiam, et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"#ref-68\">Ngiam, Brissenden &amp; Awh, 2019</a>; <a href=\"#ref-95\">Yu et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#ref-96\">Zhang &amp; Simon, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#ref-97\">Zimmer &amp; Fischer, 2020</a>). For instance, <a href=\"#ref-1\">Alvarez &amp; Cavanagh (2004)</a> demonstrated that the number of items stored in WM is affected by stimulus complexity, with particularly poor performance for Chinese characters. <a href=\"#ref-97\">Zimmer &amp; Fischer (2020)</a> expanded on this by showing that the difficulty in remembering Chinese characters is specific to individuals who are not readers of the language. That is to say, the WM capacity for Chinese characters is higher if observers have already been trained on those stimuli. Moreover, Brady, Stormer &amp; Alvarez (2016) have demonstrated that evident memory capacity for natural images is higher than memory capacity for simple colors, as natural images are the stimuli that people have had the most visual experience with compared to artificial shapes. These results can be extended to verbal memory, as performance on immediate recall of a list of words is limited by the number pre-learned chunks represented in long-term knowledge (<a href=\"#ref-17\">Chen &amp; Cowan, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#ref-42\">Hulme, Maughan &amp; Brown, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#ref-43\">Hulme et al., 2003</a>).</p><p>Even prior to these findings, there has been extensive theoretical discussion of the necessity to link WM to long-term memory representations. Among the earliest memory schemes was the <a href=\"#ref-2\">Atkinson &amp; Shiffrin (1968)</a> model of memory in which representations in long-term memory could be transferred to a short-term storage if needed. Later, <a href=\"#ref-5\">Baddeley and Hitch (1974)</a> proposed the multicomponent model of WM. In this model the short-term storage for visual information (i.e., visuospatial sketchpad) was shown to be dependent on visual semantics and episodic long-term memory with a bidirectional arrow indicating the flow of information (<a href=\"#ref-4\">Baddeley, 2000</a>). This idea is also carried by theories of activated long-term memory account (<a href=\"#ref-23\">Cowan 1988</a>, <a href=\"#ref-24\">1999</a>, <a href=\"#ref-25\">2001</a>; <a href=\"#ref-29\">Ericsson &amp; Kintsch, 1995</a>) which is also discussed by <a href=\"#ref-72\">Oberauer (2009)</a>. In this account (also known as the embedded process framework), WM representations are built by activating pre-existing representations within the long-term memory.</p><p>The above accounts (i.e., multiple components and activated long-term memory) provide a venue toward a WM mechanism integrated with long-term knowledge, but their lack of computational specificity has made it challenging to make testable predictions of <em>how</em> knowledge reflects in WM mechanisms. This includes addressing questions such as “How do we form rapid memories of novel configurations (<a href=\"#ref-53\">Lake et al., 2011</a>)?” and “Why is WM capacity higher for familiar items (<a href=\"#ref-95\">Yu et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#ref-96\">Zhang &amp; Simon, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#ref-97\">Zimmer &amp; Fischer, 2020</a>)?”</p><p>To fill this gap, we implemented a computational WM model in conjunction with a visual knowledge system named Memory for Latent Representations (MLR). The proposed model simulates how latent representations of items embedded in the visual knowledge hierarchy are encoded into WM depending on their level of familiarity. Subsequently, the encoded items in WM can be retrieved by reactivating those same latent representations in the visual knowledge system. This paper outlines a candidate model for storing and retrieving visual memories of complex shapes in a dedicated pool of neurons and provides empirical validation of the flexibility of WM.</p><div><h3>The new MLR model of working memory</h3><p>The MLR model takes advantage of recent innovations in generative deep learning models to represent and reconstruct visual stimuli that are embedded in the visual knowledge. Rather than storing unidimensional attributes as in other recent working memory models (<a href=\"#ref-10\">Bouchacourt &amp; Buschman, 2019</a>; <a href=\"#ref-84\">Schneegans &amp; Bays, 2017</a>; <a href=\"#ref-58\">Lin &amp; Oberauer, 2019</a>; <a href=\"#ref-86\">Swan &amp; Wyble, 2014</a>), MLR can encode and reconstruct arbitrary shape attributes, such as a particular handwritten digit, or an article of clothing. To achieve this, MLR uses the latent distributions from the hidden layers in a pre-trained deep neural network. In this context, <em>latent</em> is a representation of a stimulus attribute such as the shape, color, or category of a stimulus. <a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1</a> illustrates an example of digits that can be reconstructed from a simple two-dimensional latent space in a variational autoencoder (i.e., VAE) trained on the MNIST dataset, which is a collection of 60,000 hand-written digits (<a href=\"#ref-47\">Kingma &amp; Welling 2013</a>).</p><div><div><div><p><a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/03/11/2021.02.07.430171/F1.large.jpg?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;carousel=1\"><span></span></a></p></div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/03/11/2021.02.07.430171/F1.large.jpg?download=true\">Download figure</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/03/11/2021.02.07.430171/F1.large.jpg\">Open in new tab</a></li></ul></div><div><p><span>Figure 1.</span></p><p>A latent space for MNIST digits from <a href=\"#ref-47\">Kingma &amp; Welling (2013)</a>.

For instance, the connectivity of the visual system is adjusted via experiencing visual objects in a child, which results a visual knowledge system.

In the proposed framework, these two features are compression of visual information and categorical representations. Later, we show how these aspects of visual knowledge would affect WM capacity and precision of retrieved items for familiar and novel items (<a href=\"#ref-13\">Brady, et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#ref-95\">Yu et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#ref-96\">Zhang &amp; Simon, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#ref-97\">Zimmer &amp; Fischer, 2020</a>).</p><div><h4>Compression</h",

Semon<sup><a href=\"#R4\">4</a></sup> first emphasized the role of retrieval cues in remembering and introduced specific terminology to capture this process. Ecphory describes the memory retrieval process, and Semon argued that ecphory reflects the unique interplay between cues and stored memory traces at retrieval. He also coined the term engram’ to refer to such memory traces as biological entities; this may be considered his better-known contribution to the field<sup><a href=\"#R5\">5</a></sup>. Although engrams had not yet been identified empirically, the concept of ecphory became central to the cognitive psychology of memory retrieval<sup><a href=\"#R6\">6</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>In the last decade, enormous progress has been made in identifying and manipulating engrams in rodents<sup><a href=\"#R7\">7</a>–<a href=\"#R10\">10</a></sup>. In large part, this progress may be attributed to the development of tools that allow researchers to map engrams to specific neuronal ensembles and manipulate these ensembles using genetically encoded actuators<sup><a href=\"#R10\">10</a>–<a href=\"#R15\">15</a></sup> (<a href=\"#BX1\">Box 1</a>). To date, these approaches have provided evidence for the existence of engrams at the cellular level<sup><a href=\"#R7\">7</a>–<a href=\"#R9\">9</a></sup>, but they may also shed light on the biological basis of memory retrieval<sup><a href=\"#R16\">16</a>,<a href=\"#R17\">17</a></sup> (or, more precisely, ecphory). To the extent that ecphory involves reawakening specific engrams, the ability to identify and manipulate engrams is a prerequisite for gaining mechanistic insights into the retrieval process at the level of neuronal ensembles. Therefore, the recent progress in understanding engrams puts us in position to ask meaningful questions about the neurobiological basis of retrieval. Here we evaluate contemporary neuroscientific research on retrieval at the level of neuronal ensembles using the conceptual framework introduced by Semon and later elaborated by Tulving in his empirical and theoretical work. Although this research also has potentially interesting translational implications, they will not be covered here (but see ref.<sup><a href=\"#R18\">18</a></sup>).</p>\n<section><h2>Box 1 |. Approaches for tagging and manipulating engrams in rodents.</h2>\n<section><h3>Allocation</h3>\n<p>The allocation strategy takes advantage of the finding that, within a given brain region, eligible excitatory neurons compete for allocation to an engram. This strategy biases which neurons are allocated to an engram by artificially manipulating excitability before a training event. For example, before a training event, a small, random subpopulation of excitatory neurons (purple) is infected with a viral vector expressing a transgene that increases neuronal excitability, such as <em>ChR2</em> (<a href=\"#F5\">Box Fig. a</a>)<sup><a href=\"#R21\">21</a>,<a href=\"#R27\">27</a></sup> or <em>CREB</em><sup><a href=\"#R20\">20</a>,<a href=\"#R22\">22</a>,<a href=\"#R23\">23</a>,<a href=\"#R108\">108</a>,<a href=\"#R109\">109</a></sup>. Infected neurons with relatively greater excitability at the time of training are biased for allocation to a resulting engram (red outline). Once allocated, these neurons become both necessary (indispensable) and sufficient (inducing) components of the engram supporting a memory.</p></section><section><h3>Tagging</h3>\n<p>In the tagging strategy, neurons that happen to be sufficiently active (that would normally express an activity-dependent immediate early gene) at the time of training are tagged with an actuator (such as an excitatory or inhibitory opsin or chemogenetic construct). To tag active neurons, activity-dependent immediate early gene (IEG) promoters (c-Fos, Arc or others, including synthetic promoters such as E-SARE (enhanced synaptic activity-responsive element)<sup><a href=\"#R110\">110</a></sup>) are paired with an inducer that ‘opens the tagging window’. Two general types of inducers are used:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Tetracycline transactivator (tTA)-inducible tagging system. The initial studies<sup><a href=\"#R13\">13</a>,<a href=\"#R26\">26</a></sup> using this approach took advantage of two transgenic mouse lines (but viral vectors can also be used<sup><a href=\"#R14\">14</a></sup>). In the first transgenic line, tTA (tetracycline-controlled transactivator) is expressed downstream of an IEG promoter. In active cells, neural activity results in tTA expression. However, this process is blocked in the presence of doxycycline (DOX). In second transgenic mouse line, the transgene of interest (depicted as <em>ChR2</em> in <a href=\"#F5\">Box Fig. b</a>) is expressed downstream of a tetracycline response element <em>(TRE). TRE</em> is activated by tTA. Therefore, the absence of DOX opens the tagging window, allowing the transgene of interest to be expressed in active cells.</p></li>\n<li><p>Cre recombinase-inducible tagging system. In this system, two transgene cassettes are generally used. In the first, a tamoxifen (TAM)-dependent Cre recombinase (CreER<sup>T2</sup>) is expressed under control of an IEG promoter while in the second, a <em>loxP-flanked</em> STOP signal is placed between a constitutive promoter and the transgene of interest (<a href=\"#F5\">Box Fig. c</a>). In the absence of TAM, the transgene is not expressed. However, in the presence of TAM, Cre recombinase translocates to the nucleus, cleaves the <em>loxP</em> sites, and removes the STOP signal, allowing expression of the transgene. TAM administration opens the tagging window allowing the transgene of interest to be expressed in active cells<sup><a href=\"#R12\">12</a>,<a href=\"#R111\">111</a></sup>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<figure><p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih",

Rather, we integrate new incoming information from the surroundings in relation to our pre-existing knowledge about the world. This knowledge is accumulated across ontogenetic development through experiences during which the individual detects regularities in the environment. Growth in knowledge is one of the most prominent aspects in ontogeny and exerts its influence on memory functioning across the whole lifespan (Craik and Bialystok, <a href=\"#B17\">2006</a>). The importance of prior knowledge for memory has been introduced in the classical work of Piaget (<a href=\"#B62\">1929</a>) and Bartlett (<a href=\"#B7\">1932</a>). Bartlett (<a href=\"#B7\">1932</a>) showed that humans, while recalling a specific event, often construct these memories based on their knowledge about the world, thus illustrating the susceptibility of human memories to errors due to their reconstructive nature. In his work with children, Piaget (<a href=\"#B62\">1929</a>) showed that, in addition to the assimilation of new information into existing knowledge frames (or schemata), knowledge has to be updated frequently in order to adapt to changing demands of the environment, a process he called accommodation. Despite the long-standing recognition of the important role of prior knowledge, most psychological and cognitive neuroscience experiments are designed with the implicit assumption that learning and memory take place in a tabula rasa state of the brain. So far, surprisingly little is known about how the interaction between pre-existing knowledge and new incoming information takes place within the brain.</p>\n<p>In the following sections, we discuss both behavioral and neuroscience findings concerning the influence of prior knowledge on memory. We focus on studies that examined long-term storage of memory, as prior knowledge directly influences cognitive processes that are important for learning and retaining new information in the memory system. The representations built up from these processes form the basis of semantic memory, which is factual knowledge about the world, and episodic memory, which is memory bound in time and place (Tulving, <a href=\"#B87\">1972</a>). In the remainder of the review, we outline a developmental cognitive neuroscience perspective that combines our understanding about changes in brain structure and function across development with behavioral findings of age differences in the use of prior knowledge for remembering. This developmental cognitive neuroscience perspective shall guide future investigations of age-related changes in the use of prior knowledge for remembering in brain and behavior simultaneously. Throughout the review, we use the term prior knowledge in a broad sense as stored knowledge and beliefs about the world that have been acquired by an individual. This knowledge can be declarative (i.e., semantic, episodic) or non-declarative (e.g., implicit or procedural). We hereby acknowledge that differences among related terms such as conceptual knowledge, rule knowledge, associative knowledge, and schema are not being considered.</p></section><section><h2>Behavioral Evidence Illustrating the Influence of Prior Knowledge on Memory</h2>\n<p>In a classical study, Bransford and Johnson (<a href=\"#B12\">1972</a>) demonstrated the impact of prior knowledge on comprehension and memory. In a series of experiments, participants were asked to listen to prose passages and were afterward tested on their memory for them. Participants who received relevant knowledge or cues before listening to the passages and therefore had prior knowledge available showed improved comprehension and better recall compared to participants who either did not receive cues or received the contextual knowledge only after hearing the passages. In a second experiment, Bransford and Johnson (<a href=\"#B12\">1972</a>) used descriptions of activities that were known to the participants. They manipulated whether the participants could access this knowledge by either providing or not providing a cue that allowed the activation of an appropriate context. As expected, comprehension and recall were better for the group that received the cue beforehand as compared to the no-cue group. In sum, the results indicate that if prior knowledge is available and accessible, it facilitates comprehension and memory of new incoming information. Moreover, these findings corroborate the view that our experiences are not remembered as exact copies, but are actively integrated into one’s existing knowledge structures.</p>\n<p>In a similar vein, Craik and Lockhart (<a href=\"#B18\">1972</a>) argued that memory performance is not a simple function of the amount of encoded features (that is, the more, the better), but also of the qualitative nature of these features, i.e., how well they can be integrated into pre-existing knowledge. For example, Craik and Tulving (<a href=\"#B19\">1975</a>) demonstrated that words that were embedded in a congruent sentence context were better remembered than those that were embedded in an incongruent context (see also Schulman, <a href=\"#B71\">1974</a>). In addition to showing a general benefit for congruously encoded items, Craik and Tulving (<a href=\"#B19\">1975</a>) also showed that a semantically rich context benefits memory for congruent words but does not affect memory for incongruent words. These results were taken to implicate a more elaborative encoding for congruent as opposed to incongruent information. Also, new information is more effectively integrated into existing semantic networks when presented stimulus and context form one unit. Since Craik and Tulving (<a href=\"#B19\">1975</a>), this so-called “congruency effect” has been replicated numerous times with different stimulus materials and tasks (e.g., Staresina et al., <a href=\"#B81\">2009</a>; for a review, see Alba and Hasher, <a href=\"#B2\">1983</a>).</p>\n<p>Following the initial idea that prior knowledge benefits encoding via integration into existing semantic structures, Moscovitch and Craik (<a href=\"#B53\">1976</a>) provided a retrieval-related view on the importance of semantic context. In an incidental encoding task, participants read words on a screen and were asked to indicate whether those words either rhyme with another word, fit into a given category, or fit into a given sentence. The latter task was assumed to provide the deepest level of encoding. In addition, they manipulated retrieval conditions by irregularly presenting the initial encoding questions once more that did (yes-answers) or did not (no-answers) form a congruent unit with the target word. They showed that both cueing and congruency at retrieval enhanced recall and that this worked best in combination with deep levels of encoding. The results led the authors to postulate that recall performance depends on three factors: the quality of the trace (defined by the level of processing), the presence of retrieval cues, and the degree of congruity of the items with their context. Put differently, deep encoding comes along with a high potential of being remembered. The extent to which this potential is realized, however, depends on whether the retrieval context provides enough information to recreate the encoding context and on whether this context and the target stimulus form one unit. When all (or some) conditions are met, the retrieval of accurate targets will be facilitated.</p>\n<p>Although it is well accepted that semantic congruency promotes memory performance, events that are incongruent to the prevailing context have also been shown to-be-remembered well. For example, the classical von Restorff-effect (Köhler and von Restorff, <a href=\"#B38\">1937</a>) denotes that an item that is distinct from its surrounding items is more likely to-be-remembered than one that is not (also called “isolation effect”). Whether a given memory event profits from congruency or incongruency probably depends on several contextual features, such as the occurrence ratio between congruent and incongruent information (Alba and Hasher, <a href=\"#B2\">1983</a>; Rojahn and Pettigrew, <a href=\"#B67\">1992</a>). By taking a 50/50 ratio of congruent and incongruent stimuli, differences in saliency are reduced, which would be more prominent for, say, an 80/20 ratio in which the less frequent material type is expected to show isolation-like memory benefits (Hunt and Lamb, <a href=\"#B36\">2001</a>).</p>",
