# Re:DNA
*Knowledge evolves through structured transformation.*

## What's This?
Think DNA, but for ideas. Like how DNA makes you you, Re:DNA helps ideas become... more interesting ideas.

```
Pizza := {
  base: "knowledge foundation"
  toppings: [active ideas]
  cooking: transformation
}

Result := better pizza && better ideas
```

## How It Works

### Knowledge DNA
```
Idea = {
  what: core concept
  state: awake | sleeping
  where: fits in what context
}

Transform = old_idea -> new_idea
  (but keep the good parts)
```

### Real Example: Pizza Evolution
```
Basic_Pizza = {
  what: "flat bread + sauce"
  state: awake
  where: "hungry nights"
}

Hawaiian_Pizza = transform(Basic_Pizza) {
  add: pineapple
  trigger: controversy
  preserve: still pizza though
}
```

## Core Features
- Ideas can be awake or sleeping
- Mix and match without breaking things
- Smart enough to know when pineapple doesn't belong
- Learns from mistakes (unlike your ex)

## System Parts
- Brain-like storage (remembers stuff)
- Fact-checking (no fake pizzas)
- Plays nice with other ideas
- Self-fixes when things get weird

## Use It For
- Making knowledge systems that aren't boring
- Teaching computers to think (but not too much)
- Understanding why ideas work (or don't)
- Building better pizza theories

## Get Started
1. Clone your brain
2. Add some ideas
3. Watch them evolve
4. Profit?

*"If ideas were pizza, Re:DNA would be the recipe book that writes itself"*
